They kept their eyes wide and awake. There wasn't\nmuch to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting.\n  \n \n  Marnagan said, \"We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat\nwith except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got\nfifty minutes to prove you're right. After that—right or wrong—you'll\nbe Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all\nyou like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any\nwords, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about\nit. As for me—\" he twisted his glossy red face. \"Keeping alive is me\nhobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order.\"\n  \n \n  Click nodded. \"Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.\nIt's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and\nthe crash this way.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far\ndown, and the green eyes blazed.\n  \n \n  They stopped, together.\n  \n \n  \"Oops!\" Click said.\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" Marnagan blinked. \"Did you feel\n   \n   that\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and\nlimbless, suddenly. \"Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!\"\n  \n \n  They ran back. \"Let's try it again.\"\n  \n \n  They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.\n\"Gravity should not act this way, Click.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that—it's Gunther! No\nwonder we fell so fast—we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!\nGunther'd do anything to—did I say\n   \n   anything\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand\ncame up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable\nhorrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with\nnumerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some\ntubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along\nin the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.\n  \n \n  Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke\ncold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed\nafter him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in\nClick's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt\nthe creatures at all.\n  \n \n  \"Irish!\" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline\ntoward the mouth a small cave. \"This way, fella!\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. \"They're\ntoo big; they can't get us in here!\" Click's voice gasped it out,\nas Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.\nInstinctively, Hathaway added, \"Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a\nscene!\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn your damn camera!\" yelled Marnagan. \"They might come in!\"\n  \n \n  \"Use your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,\neh, Click?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah. Sure.\n   \n   You\n   \n  enjoyed it, every moment of it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I did that.\" Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. \"Now, what\nwill we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let me think—\"\n  \n \n  \"Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact.\"\n\n[Chapter: Spawning_Ground_5]\nThe race had blundered safely through its discovery of atomic weapons\ninto a peace that had lasted two hundred years. It had managed to\nprevent an interplanetary war with the Venus colonists. It had found\na drive that led to the stars, and hadn't even found intelligent life\nthere to be dangerous on the few worlds that had cultures of their own.\n  \n \n  But forty years ago, observations from beyond the Solar System had\nfinally proved that the sun was going to go nova.\n  \n \n  It wouldn't be much of an explosion, as such things go—but it would\nrender the whole Solar System uninhabitable for millenia. To survive,\nman had to colonize.\n  \n \n  And there were no worlds perfect for him, as Earth had been. The\nexplorers went out in desperation to find what they could; the\nterraforming teams did what they could. And then the big starships\nbegan filling worlds with colonists, carried in deep sleep to conserve\nspace.\n  \n \n  Almost eighty worlds. The nearest a four month journey from Earth and\nfour more months back.\n  \n \n  In another ten years, the sun would explode, leaving man only on the\nfootholds he was trying to dig among other solar systems. Maybe some\nof the strange worlds would let men spread his seed again. Maybe none\nwould be spawning grounds for mankind in spite of the efforts. Each was\nprecious as a haven for the race.\n  \n \n  If this world could be used, it would be nearer than most. If not, as\nit now seemed, no more time could be wasted here.\n  \n \n  Primitives could be overcome, maybe. It would be ruthless and unfair to\nstrip them of their world, but the first law was survival.\n  \n \n  But how could primitives do what these must have done?\n  \n \n  He studied the spear he had salvaged. It was on a staff made of\ncemented bits of smaller wood from the scrub growth, skillfully\nlaminated. The point was of delicately chipped flint, done as no human\nhand had been able to do for centuries.\n  \n \n  \"Beautiful primitive work,\" he muttered.\n  \n \n  Jane pulled the coffee cup away from her lips and snorted. \"You can\nsee a lot more of it out there,\" she suggested.\n  \n \n  He went to the port and glanced out. About sixty of the things were\nsquatting in the clearing fog, holding lances and staring at the ship.\nThey were perhaps a thousand yards away, waiting patiently. For what?\nFor the return of their leader—or for something that would give the\nship to them?\n  \n \n  Gwayne grabbed the phone and called Barker. \"How's the captive coming?\"\n  \n \n  Barker's voice sounded odd.\n  \n \n  \"Physically fine. You can see him. But—\"\n  \n \n  Gwayne dropped the phone and headed for the little sick bay. He swore\nat Doc for not calling him at once, and then at himself for not\nchecking up sooner. Then he stopped at the sound of voices.\n  \n \n  There was the end of a question from Barker and a thick, harsh growling\nsound that lifted the hair along the nape of Gwayne's neck. Barker\nseemed to understand, and was making a comment as the captain dashed in.\n  \n \n  The captive was sitting on the bunk, unbound and oddly unmenacing. The\nthick features were relaxed and yet somehow intent. He seemed to make\nsome kind of a salute as he saw Gwayne enter, and his eyes burned up\nunerringly toward the device on the officer's cap.\n  \n \n  \"Haarroo, Cabbaan!\" the thing said.\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_2]\nSilence came and engulfed all the noise, ate it up and swallowed it.\nHathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked\nto his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold\nthat pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the\nwreckage into that silence.\n  \n \n  He didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his\nfingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there,\nthinking \"Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll—\"\n  \n \n  A hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven\nfeet of bellowing manhood from the wreck.\n  \n \n  \"Hold it!\" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera\nwhirred. \"Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed\nfrom asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!\"\n  \n \n  \"From the toe of me boot!\" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders\nflexed inside his vac-suit. \"I might've died in there, and you nursin'\nthat film-contraption!\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. \"I never thought of that.\nMarnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always\nhave. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to.\" Hathaway\nstared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he\ncouldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down,\npale. \"Where are we?\"\n  \n \n  \"A million miles from nobody.\"\n  \n \n  They stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that\nstretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars.\nOverhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look\nsick.\n  \n \n  \"If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking\nhands the other side of this rock in two hours.\" Marnagan shook his mop\nof dusty red hair. \"And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd\ncapture that Gunther lad!\"\n  \n \n  His voice stopped and the silence spoke.\n  \n \n  Hathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. \"I checked\nmy oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes of breathing left.\"\n  \n \n  The silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric\nrocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply\nmashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or\n   \n   was\n   \n  suffocation a better death...?\n   \n   Sixty minutes.\n   \n \n \n  They stood and looked at one another.\n  \n \n  \"Damn that meteor!\" said Marnagan, hotly.\n  \n \n  Hathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out:\n\"Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked\nit right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot.\nSpace-meteors are never hot and glowing. If it's proof you want, I've\ngot it here, on film.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan winced his freckled square of face. \"It's not proof we need\nnow, Click. Oxygen. And then\n   \n   food\n   \n  . And then some way back to Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway went on saying his thoughts: \"This is Gunther's work. He's\nhere somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.\nOh, God, this would make great news-release stuff if we ever get back\nto Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed by a pirate\nwhose dirty face has never been seen, Gunther by name, finally wins\nthrough to a triumphant finish. Photographed on the spot, in color, by\nyours truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please notice.\"\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_11]\nHathaway swatted him on his back-side. \"Look here, you egocentric son\nof Erin, there's more work to be done. More pirates to be captured. The\nPatrol is still marching around and someone might be suspicious if they\nlooked too close and saw all that red hair.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right, Click, we'll clean up the rest of them now. We're a\ncombination, we two, we are. I take it all back about your pictures,\nClick, if you hadn't thought of taking pictures of me and inserting\nit into those telepath machines we'd be dead ducks now. Well—here I\ngo....\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway stopped him. \"Hold it. Until I load my camera again.\"\n  \n \n  Irish grinned. \"Hurry it up. Here come three guards. They're unarmed.\nI think I'll handle them with me fists for a change. The gentle art of\nuppercuts. Are you ready, Hathaway?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ready.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan lifted his big ham-fists.\n  \n \n  The camera whirred. Hathaway chuckled, to himself.\n  \n \n  What a sweet fade-out this was!\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_1]\nThe Monster Maker\n  \n \n  By RAY BRADBURY\n  \n \n  \"Get Gunther,\" the official orders read. It\n   \n  was to laugh! For Click and Irish were\n   \n  marooned on the pirate's asteroid—their only\n   \n  weapons a single gun and a news-reel camera.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Suddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get\nscared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening\nto it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a\ndamned sweet picture of everything that was happening.\n  \n \n  The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,\nwrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the\ndark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this\nmeteor coming like blazing fury.\n  \n \n  Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's\nskin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the\nrear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.\n  \n \n  There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was\npicked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't\nlong in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to\nhis camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had\nbeen of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of\nthe controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.\n  \n \n  It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids\nrushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a\ntom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.\n  \n \n  Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the\nnearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you\nended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of\nmetal death. What a fade-out!\n  \n \n  \"Irish!\" he heard himself say. \"Is this IT?\"\n  \n \n  \"Is this\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.\n  \n \n  \"Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan fumed. \"I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm\nready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!\"\n  \n \n  They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of\ngravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.\n  \n \n  The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over\nand stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled\naround—human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,\nair and energy flung out.\n  \n \n  Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking\nquick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach\nfilm, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like\n   \n   this\n   \n  one! His\nbrain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his\ncamera.\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_8]\nThe air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head\nswimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He\nlet himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't\nhave a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!\n  \n \n  A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that\nyellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,\nair hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a\nproton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard\nhad his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: \"I think I'll let\nyou stand right there and die,\" he said quietly. \"That what Gunther\nwanted, anway. A nice sordid death.\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.\n  \n \n  \"Don't move!\" he snapped. \"I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One\ntwitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind\nyou! Freeze!\"\n  \n \n  The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped\nhis gun to the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Get his gun, Irish.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.\n  \n \n  Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. \"Thanks for\nposing,\" he said. \"That shot will go down in film history for candid\nacting.\"\n  \n \n  \"What!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door\nleading into the Base?\"\n  \n \n  The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.\n  \n \n  Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.\n\"Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double\ntime! Double!\"\n  \n \n  Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on\ntheir backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,\nhid him in a huge trash receptacle. \"Where he belongs,\" observed Irish\ntersely.\n  \n \n  They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing\nmore than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.\nPerfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was\nshort-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to\nrocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for\ncargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the\nswarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't\nwanted. They were scared off.\n  \n \n  The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of\nintricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film\nwith images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them\ninto thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.\n  \n \n  \"So here we are, still not much better off than we were,\" growled\nIrish. \"We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn\nup any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the\nmonsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?\"\n  \n \n  \"What good would that do?\" Hathaway gnawed his lip. \"They wouldn't fool\nthe engineers who created them, you nut.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. \"Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come\nriding over the hill—\"\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_10]\nOne of the Patrolmen stopped firing, and ran toward Click and the\nBuilding. He got inside. \"Did you see them run, Click boy? What an\nidea. How did we do?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fine, Irish. Fine!\"\n  \n \n  \"So here's Gunther, the spalpeen! Gunther, the little dried up pirate,\neh?\" Marnagan whacked Hathaway on the back. \"I'll have to hand it to\nyou, this is the best plan o' battle ever laid out. And proud I was to\nfight with such splendid men as these—\" He gestured toward the Plaza.\n  \n \n  Click laughed with him. \"You should be proud. Five hundred Patrolmen\nwith hair like red banners flying, with thick Irish brogues and broad\nshoulders and freckles and blue eyes and a body as tall as your\nstories!\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan roared. \"I always said, I said—if ever there could be an\narmy of Marnagans, we could lick the whole damn uneeverse! Did you\nphotograph it, Click?\"\n  \n \n  \"I did.\" Hathaway tapped his camera happily.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, then, won't that be a scoop for you, boy? Money from the Patrol so\nthey can use the film as instruction in Classes and money from Cosmic\nFilms for the news-reel headlines! And what a scene, and what acting!\nFive hundred duplicates of Steve Marnagan, broadcast telepathically\ninto the minds of the pirates, walking across a Plaza, capturing the\nwhole she-bang! How did you like my death-scenes?\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a ham. And anyway—five hundred duplicates, nothing!\" said\nClick. He ripped the film-spool from the camera, spread it in the air\nto develop, inserted it in the micro-viewer. \"Have a look—\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan looked. \"Ah, now. Ah, now,\" he said over and over. \"There's\nthe Plaza, and there's Gunther's men fighting and then they're turning\nand running. And what are they running from? One man! Me. Irish\nMarnagan! Walking all by myself across the lawn, paralyzing them. One\nagainst a hundred, and the cowards running from me!\n  \n \n  \"Sure, Click, this is better than I thought. I forgot that the film\nwouldn't register telepathic emanations, them other Marnagans. It\nmakes it look like I'm a mighty brave man, does it not? It does. Ah,\nlook—look at me, Hathaway, I'm enjoying every minute of it, I am.\"\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_5]\nClick shrugged. \"Still doubt it? Okay. Look.\" He tapped his camera and\na spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped\nit out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it\ndeveloped, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing\nfilm. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,\nleaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the\nimpressions. Quick stuff.\n  \n \n  Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,\nClick handed the whole thing over. \"Look.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. \"Ah,\nClick. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.\"\n  \n \n  \"Huh?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid\nmonsters complete.\"\n  \n \n  \"What!\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:\nPictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally\nwith\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  ; Marnagan shooting his gun at\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  ; Marnagan\npretending to be happy in front of\n   \n   nothing\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Then, closeup—of—NOTHING!\n  \n \n  The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair\nlike a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.\nMaybe—\n  \n \n  Hathaway said it, loud: \"Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this\nmess! Here—\"\n  \n \n  He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,\nthe beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the\nmonsters weren't there, they weren't there.\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Marnagan. \"But step outside this cave—\"\n  \n \n  \"If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,\" said Click.\n  \n \n  Marnagan scowled. \"You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or\ninfra-red or something that won't come out on film?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nuts! Any color\n   \n   we\n   \n  see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, where\n   \n   you\n   \n  going?\" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man\ntried pushing past him.\n  \n \n  \"Get out of the way,\" said Hathaway.\n  \n \n  Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. \"If anyone is going anywhere,\nit'll be me does the going.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't let you do that, Irish.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not?\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd be going on my say-so.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ain't your say-so good enough for me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess—\"\n  \n \n  \"If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand\naside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their\nbones.\" He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist\nexcept under an inch of porous metal plate. \"Your express purpose on\nthis voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later\nfor teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand\neducation. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me\nprofile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The\nLion's Den.\"\n  \n \n  \"Irish, I—\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up and load up.\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.\n  \n \n  \"Ready, Click?\"\n  \n \n  \"I—I guess so,\" said Hathaway. \"And remember, think it hard, Irish.\nThink it hard. There aren't any animals—\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep me in focus, lad.\"\n  \n \n  \"All the way, Irish.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,\ntwo, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters were\nwaiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.\n  \n \n  Right out into the middle of them....\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_6]\nThat was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and the\nmonsters!\n  \n \n  Only now it was only Marnagan.\n  \n \n  No more monsters.\n  \n \n  Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. \"Hey, Click, look\nat me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail and\nran away!\"\n  \n \n  \"Ran, hell!\" cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed and\nanimated. \"They just plain vanished. They were only imaginative\nfigments!\"\n  \n \n  \"And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, you\ncoward!\"\n  \n \n  \"Smile when you say that, Irish.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears in\nyour sweet grey eyes?\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn,\" swore the photographer, embarrassedly. \"Why don't they put\nwindow-wipers in these helmets?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll take it up with the Board, lad.\"\n  \n \n  \"Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in one\nhunk, I couldn't help—Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are part\nof his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased back\ninto their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothing\nsuspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animals\nkill them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill.\"\n  \n \n  \"Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they could\nhave frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If\nthat isn't being dangerous—\"\n  \n \n  The Irishman whistled.\n  \n \n  \"But, we've got to\n   \n   move\n   \n  , Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.\nIn that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,\nGunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters.\" Click\nattached his camera to his mid-belt. \"Gunther probably thinks we're\ndead by now.

He shook his head and\nfelt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady\nhimself, and swayed. \"I—I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.\nThis excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. \"Hold tight, Click. The\nguy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals\ncame from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come\nback!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come back? How?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we\nbelieve in them again, they'll return.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan didn't like it. \"Won't—won't they kill us—if they come—if\nwe believe in 'em?\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. \"Not if we believe\nin them to a\n   \n   certain point\n   \n  .

We only want to\n   \n   see\n   \n  them coming at us again.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Do\n   \n  we, now?\"\n  \n \n  \"With twenty minutes left, maybe less—\"\n  \n \n  \"All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. \"Just think—I will see\nthe monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.\nThink it over and over.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. \"And—what if I forget to remember\nall that? What if I get excited...?\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking at\nIrish.\n  \n \n  Marnagan cursed. \"All right, lad. Let's have at it!\"\n  \n \n  The monsters returned.\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_4]\nThey sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt\nfunny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters\nand Gunther and—\n  \n \n  \"Which one will you be having?\" asked Irish, casually. \"A red one or a\nblue one?\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway laughed nervously. \"A pink one with yellow ruffles—Good God,\nnow you've got\n   \n   me\n   \n  doing it. Joking in the face of death.\"\n  \n \n  \"Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.\"\n  \n \n  That didn't please the photographer. \"I'm an Anglo-Swede,\" he pointed\nout.\n  \n \n  Marnagan shifted uneasily. \"Here, now. You're doing nothing but\nsitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take\nme a profile shot of the beasties and myself.\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. \"What in hell's the use? All\nthis swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then,\" retorted Marnagan, \"we'll develop it for our own benefit; while\nwaitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our\nrescue!\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway snorted. \"U.S. Cavalry.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. \"Snap me this pose,\" he\nsaid. \"I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,\nmy capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace\nnegotiations betwixt me and these pixies.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver\nfor nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running\naround in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but\nhis mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of\nMarnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.\n  \n \n  Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling\nfor the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without\nmuch effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death\nwall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying\nanything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they\nhad sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.\n  \n \n  When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it\nup arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:\n  \n \n  \"Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt\nback on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,\nwhat's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space\nwar isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory\nis lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which\ndispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?\nSuper-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.\nIt's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes\nunseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan rumbled. \"Where is the dirty son, then!\"\n  \n \n  \"He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent—them.\" Hathaway nodded at\nthe beasts. \"People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from\nwounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that—the animals\ntend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle\nhis attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the\nPatrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,\nthen.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't see no Base around.\"\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_7]\nA soundless deluge of them, pouring over the rubbled horizon, swarming\nin malevolent anticipation about the two men.\n  \n \n  \"This way, Irish. They come from this way! There's a focal point, a\nsending station for these telepathic brutes. Come on!\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway sludged into the pressing tide of color, mouths, contorted\nfaces, silvery fat bodies misting as he plowed through them.\n  \n \n \n \n  Marnagan was making good progress ahead of Hathaway. But he stopped and\nraised his gun and made quick moves with it. \"Click! This one here!\nIt's real!\" He fell back and something struck him down. His immense\nframe slammed against rock, noiselessly.\n  \n \n  Hathaway darted forward, flung his body over Marnagan's, covered the\nhelmet glass with his hands, shouting:\n  \n \n  \"Marnagan! Get a grip, dammit! It's not real—don't let it force into\nyour mind! It's not real, I tell you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Click—\" Marnagan's face was a bitter, tortured movement behind glass.\n\"Click—\" He was fighting hard. \"I—I—sure now. Sure—\" He smiled.\n\"It—it's only a shanty fake!\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan's thick lips opened. \"It's only a fake,\" he said. And then,\nirritated, \"Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!\"\n  \n \n  Hathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and\nlittle bubbles danced in his eyes. \"Irish,\n   \n   you\n   \n  forget the monsters.\nLet me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might\nforget.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan showed his teeth. \"Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And\nbesides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty.\"\n  \n \n  The outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.\nEvidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.\n  \n \n  \"We'll be taking our chances on guard,\" hissed Irish. \"I'll go ahead,\ndraw their attention, maybe get captured. Then,\n   \n   you\n   \n  show up with\n   \n   your\n   \n  gun....\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't got one.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They\nprobably got scanners out. Let them see me—\"\n  \n \n  And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about\nfive hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved\nup, and there was a door opening in the rock.\n  \n \n  His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. \"A\ndoor, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!\"\n  \n \n  Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the\nthud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.\n  \n \n  Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast.\n  \n \n  \"All right, put 'em up!\" a new harsh voice cried over a different\nradio. One of Gunther's guards.\n  \n \n  Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.\n  \n \n  The strange harsh voice said, \"That's better. Don't try and pick that\ngun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off.\nHow'd you get past the animals?\"\n  \n \n  Click started running. He switched off his\n   \n   sending\n   \n  audio, kept his\n   \n   receiving\n   \n  on. Marnagan, weaponless.\n   \n   One\n   \n  guard. Click gasped. Things\nwere getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running\nand listening to Marnagan's lying voice:\n  \n \n  \"I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles\nand stacked them up to dry, ya louse!\" Marnagan said. \"But, damn you,\nthey killed my partner before he had a chance!\"\n  \n \n  The guard laughed.\n\n[Chapter: The_Monster_Maker_9]\n\"Irish!\" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. \"Irish. The U.S.\nCavalry it is!\" His eyes darted over the machines. \"Here. Help me.\nWe'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century.\"\n  \n \n  Marnagan winced. \"You breathing oxygen or whiskey?\"\n  \n \n  \"There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture\nof Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face\nwhen you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an\nactor are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's a silly question.\"\n  \n \n  \"You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of\nyou, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart\nand fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down\nand twitch on the ground. Is that clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula....\"\n  \n \n  An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a\nsort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,\nlined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a\nwide, green-lawned Plaza.\n  \n \n  Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked\nacross the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that\nwas pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.\n  \n \n  He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.\n  \n \n  He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and\npushed him into a room where Gunther sat.\n  \n \n  Hathaway looked at him. \"So you're Gunther?\" he said, calmly. The\npirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,\nquestioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of\nmetal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he\ncould speak, Hathaway said:\n  \n \n  \"Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and\nwe're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men\nagainst your eighty-five.\"\n  \n \n  Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands\ntwitched in his lap. \"You are bluffing,\" he said, finally, with a firm\ndirectness. \"A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the\nlast. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being\npursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.\"\n  \n \n  \"Both. The other guy went after the Patrol.\"\n  \n \n  \"Impossible!\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther.\"\n  \n \n  A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging\non carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and\nstarted yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side\nof his office. He stared, hard.\n  \n \n  The Patrol was coming!\n  \n \n  Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol.\nFive hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis\nguns with them in their tight hands.\n  \n \n  Gunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air.\n\"Get out there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!\"\n  \n \n  Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway\nhad to credit them on that. They took it, standing.\n  \n \n  Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.\nHis camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him\nfrom filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was\nthrowing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his\nfragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.\n  \n \n  Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three\nof the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and\ntwitch. God, what photography!\n  \n \n  Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He\nfired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.\nThen Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos\ntaking place immediately outside his window.\n  \n \n  The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And\nout of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, \"Here!\"\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The crash is not an accident, but a deliberate act that strands Hathaway and Marnagan in a hostile environment. This is established early when Hathaway observes the meteor's unnatural appearance:  \n##begin_quote##Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked it right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot. Space-meteors are never hot and glowing.##end_quote##\n\n2. The crash leaves them with limited resources and in immediate danger, setting up the survival stakes for the rest of the story:  \n##begin_quote##Upon the sharp meteoric rocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply mashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or was suffocation a better death...? Sixty minutes.##end_quote##\n\n3. The crash is revealed to be part of Gunther’s plan, using artificial gravity and telepathic monsters to destroy or scare off intruders, making survival and the hunt for Gunther central to the plot:  \n##begin_quote##Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt back on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So, what's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down.##end_quote##\n\n##Answer: The crash of Hathaway and Marnagan’s ship is significant because it is a deliberate attack by Gunther, designed to strand and kill them using artificial gravity and telepathic monsters. This event forces them into a desperate fight for survival in a hostile environment, drives the plot as they must confront unexpected dangers, and ultimately leads them to uncover and defeat Gunther’s operation."}], "metadata": {"id": "13", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["The crash of Hathaway and Marnagan’s ship is the precipitating event for the events that follow, but it is also more than that.  Hathaway states shortly after the crash that the meteor that hit their ship was deliberately aimed at them with force, based on it being “hot and glowing” at the time of the collision.  Hathaway hypothesizes at that time that Gunther, the man Marnagan is trying to capture on their mission, had engineered the crash.  A short time later, when walking along the surface of the planet, Hathaway notices sudden weight loss.  After he and Marnagan test it and confirm that it really happened, they conclude that their ship was not only hit by a meteor, it was dragged down to the planet by an unnatural amount of gravity, more than the planet is generating.  They then meet horrifying, dangerous monsters, but these are revealed in short order to be telepathic projections.  They are able to dispel the images of the monsters by their own belief that the monsters are not really there, then summon them back by imagining that they are there, but that the monsters cannot harm them.  In this way, the monsters lead them to Gunther, who is captured when Marnagan and Hathaway use the telepathic projectors that generated the “monster” images to generate hundreds of images of Marnagan, making it appear that there is an army ready to take over Gunther’s base and capture or kill all his men.  All of this flows from the initial crash engineered by Gunther with the propelled meteor and the area of super-gravity that pulled the ship down to the planet.  Gunther hoped to make the ship disappear and Marnagan and Hathaway along with it.  Instead, they crashed on the single planet where they could find him and had to take on an immediate quest to search for him in order to survive, as they had limited oxygen and needed to find the only other humans on the planet in order to replenish their supply.", "The crash in the opening scene sets up the conflict with Gunther in the climax of the story. Gunther is responsible for the meteor that strikes the spaceship and makes it crash on the asteroid. He is also responsible for the monsters that first terrify Hathaway and Marnagan and that later lead the men to his hideout inside the asteroid. Hathaway speculates that Gunther crashes or pulls ships onto his asteroid. Gunther is short on men, and space weapons are inaccurate, so he uses super-gravity to crash the ships. The people die from a lack of air or food or their injuries from the crash. Since there are no signs of weapons, if the Patrol ever shows up, it looks like the people died of accidental deaths rather than murder. The crash makes it possible for Marnagan to finally reach Gunter, a space pirate that no one has ever seen before.", "The crash of Hathaway’s and Marnagan’s ship in the opening scene of the story is significant both because it brings them to the asteroid where Gunther is hiding, and because it helps them figure out how Gunther is stealing cargo. Their ship is brought down at great speed by meteorites that Gunther and his troops launch at it, and then pulled in by a super-gravity situation they have set up. Hathaway and Marnagan realize the gravity is at play when they seem to lose weight as they get further from the ship. Their own ship wreck experience points them toward discovering how to get to Gunther. \n", "The crash at the beginning of the story is perpetuated by a meteor that Click later determines was sent as a projectile by Gunther himself. He presumes this was done in conjunction with the artificial gravity of the asteroid base in order to fell cargo ships to gather supplies for Gunther and his limited crew of fellow pirates. This crash sets in motion the action that forces Marnagan and Click to confront the monsters, whom Click soon realizes are telepathically imposed and not real at all. Because of this encounter with the monsters, Click discovers a way to defeat Gunther and his forces while dealing with limited resources and using his own technology against him. The crash also provides a dramatic moment in Click’s film."]}}

Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the\ncrows for breakfast.\" Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a little\ngrin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.\n  \n \n  \"You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O'Rielly\nsaid in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why\ndid Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?\"\n  \n \n  \"Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled,\nlike to himself, \"they'd of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep,\nguess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live.\nDames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won't be one\nmuch longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselves\nbut didn't, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizing\nto take over Venus, I guess.\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trillium\nbefore her revolution. \"All right, Callahan, why did 'our boy' leave\nGrandmamma?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, ma'am,\" Callahan sighed like he hadn't heard a word O'Rielly\nsaid, \"you could sweet-talk 'em, kiss 'em and hold 'em tighter'n\nBilly-be-damned. And that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not sure,\" O'Rielly said, \"what you mean by, 'that's all.'\"\n  \n \n  \"Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards?\nCourse not.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ain't nothing can match the natural growed-on variety, no, ma'am.\nVenus guy kisses a Venus dame, his beards grabs her roundst the ears.\"\n  \n \n  \"So what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Tickles 'em, boy, tickles 'em!\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_3]\n\"Venus boys rared up and served notice that if Earth ever got any funny\nnotions, right away there wouldn't be enough Earth left to hide in an\natom's eyebrow.

What?\" Callahan blinked like waking from a trance; even groaned\nto himself, something that sounded like, \"Blabbering like I'd had\na nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.\" Then\nCallahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. \"Look! I was\na full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred\ntwenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more,\nyou hear!

The dear little stowaway\nwas saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her\nlovely neck and his own forever.\n  \n \n  O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had not\nopened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely\nhis dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't she\nhave brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!\n  \n \n  At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old\nhead. \"Berta!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm Trillium,\" she assured Callahan sweetly. \"But Grandmamma's\nname is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and\ntwenty-five years ago.\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_1]\nIMAGE OF SPLENDOR\n  \n \n  By LU KELLA\n  \n \n \n   From Venus to Earth, and all the way between,\n    \n   it was a hell of a world for men ... and\n    \n   Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly particularly.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The intercom roared fit to blow O'Rielly back to Venus. \"Burner Four!\"\n  \n \n  \"On my way, sir!\"\n  \n \n  At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice Burnerman\nO'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was already\nthrowing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumble\nwhipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of\nthe universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one\nchance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The\nthrobbing rumble changed tone.\n  \n \n  Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.\n\"Well, Mr. O'Rielly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old\nBurner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn't you lock them controls before\nblast-off?\"\n  \n \n  \"If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting,\" O'Rielly\nanswered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have\nregistered before blast-off—wouldn't it, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know yet, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\n  \n \n  The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on\nthis ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In a\nhundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O'Rielly\nin pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one\nhad moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from\nEarth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven\nthrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all\naboard gone in a churning cloud.\n  \n \n  Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of\nthe thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't any\nmore? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch\nroom. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed\nand a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the Burner\nChief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient\nofficers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watch\nroom. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.\nBy now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\ninquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\n  \n \n  Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\nmouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Rielly\nsaw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\nsome God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\nhis brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\nthat way.\n  \n \n  She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\neither. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\nO'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!\n  \n \n  \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\nof loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. \"I\ncouldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door.\nSo I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\nnaturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turned\nresetting the control.\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_4]\n\"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and\nwas being slapped together again. \"O'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced\npirate, couldn't you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up,\nyou don't have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we\ndon't flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in\na zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into\nO'Rielly's shower.\n  \n \n  O'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite\nTrillium. Just like that, O'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a\nspiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open\nthe doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap\nand coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\n  \n \n  \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\"\nTrillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\n  \n \n  Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this\nship. O'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don't you\nworry about another thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the\nway Grandmamma knew it would!\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly's shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko,\nbounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No,\ndon't tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\n  \n \n  \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted\nto know.\n  \n \n  The watch room's door had opened. Wouldn't think the Old Woman was a\nday over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform\nprobably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure.\nFrosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she\nlooked at O'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\n  \n \n  Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\n  \n \n  Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly\nerect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully\nrobed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap\nlesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed\nfrom his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle\nof two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\n  \n \n  She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked\nyou a question, did I not?\"\n  \n \n  \"Believe you did, ma'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the\nanswer is, ma'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly and me was\ndiscussing—ah—matrimony, ma'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly\nhere is considering it, ma'am.\"\n  \n \n  Wasn't too bad a fib. The more O'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more\nideas he got of doing things he'd never dreamt of before in his life.\nYes, ma'am!\n  \n \n  \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman's look was fit to\nfreeze O'Rielly's brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you\ndown here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma'am!\"\nCallahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense—I mean,\nwomen—merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing\nthe control phenomenon, ma'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young\nBurnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan\nsaid with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed 'twouldn't\nbother me none if there wasn't one of the things left in the world!\nPresent company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a\ncourtly bow.\n  \n \n  \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan's face,\nthen in O'Rielly's vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\"\nshe muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something\nhorrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there\nagain. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don't you know what your shower is for?\nThen use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this\nburner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join\nme, Your Excellency?\"\n  \n \n  \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O'Rielly and Callahan much as\nhe might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female\never told any Venus man what to do.\n  \n \n  The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two\nsteps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly\nblowing her gaskets completely, O'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the\ndoor, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed\nof person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His\nExcellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with\nsweat.\n  \n \n  Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You\nfirst, Your Excellency.\"\n  \n \n  \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\n\"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\n  \n \n  No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old\nWoman, a prime symbol of her gender's superiority, whipped a razor edge\nonto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain's quarters are more\nsatisfactory.\"\n  \n \n  \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_5]\nSeeming to grind her teeth, the Old O Woman turned abruptly to leave\nO'Rielly's watch room. Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from busting\nout laughing for joy.\n  \n \n  Old Woman had been flimflammed for fair! Dear Trillium was saved! And\nbetwixt O'Rielly's grand brain and Callahan's great experience she'd be\nhappy forever.\n  \n \n  A fine loud \"thump,\" however, was now heard. Old Woman whirled back and\nyanked open the doors under O'Rielly's bunk.\n  \n \n  \"Of all the sappy hiding places!\" Callahan yelped, in surprise of\ncourse.\n  \n \n  \"Trillium?\" His Excellency bellowed as if stung by one of the\nsabre-tailed hornets of his native planet. \"Trillium!\"\n  \n \n  \"Trillium,\" O'Rielly pleaded in loving anguish, \"why do you have to\nkeep coming out of hiding just when nobody's going to find you?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyes merely became deep pools in which O'Rielly would have gladly\ndrowned himself if he could.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"There are rewards,\" the Old Woman said with the deadly coldness of\nouter space, \"for Earthmen found in a Venus woman's company, and for\nher leaving her planet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up!\" His Excellency's ear beards were standing straight out\nsideways. \"I'll handle this!\"\n  \n \n  \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent\nEarth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\"\n  \n \n  \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard\nback to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President\nof Venus and this thing can mean war!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes! War in which people will actually die!\" As His Excellency paled\nat that grisly remark, the Old Woman spoke through her teeth at\nO'Rielly, Callahan and Trillium. \"All right, come along!\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly joined the death march gladly. He felt the way Callahan\nlooked: ready to wrap his arms around Trillium's brave loveliness and\nprotect it to his last breath of life.\n  \n \n  Old Woman led the way to her office. Jabbed some buttons on her desk.\nPanels on opposite walls lit up.\n  \n \n  \"Presidents of Earth and Venus, please,\" the Old Woman stated evenly.\n\"Interplanetary emergency.\"\n  \n \n  Highly groomed flunkies appeared on the panels and were impersonally\npleasant.\n  \n \n  \"Madame President's office. She is in a Cabinet meeting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. President's office. He is in personal command of our glorious war\nefforts.\"\n  \n \n  Old Woman sighed through her teeth. \"Venus woman aboard this ship.\nStowaway. Rattle that around your belfries.\"\n  \n \n  The flunkies' faces went slack with shock, then were replaced by a\nblizzard of scrambled faces and torrents of incoherent voices.\n  \n \n  Finally on the Earth panel appeared the famous classic features. \"The\nfacts, if you please, Captain Hatwoody.\"\n  \n \n  The Venus panel finally held steady on universally notorious features,\nthat were as fierce as an eagle's, in a fancy war helmet. \"Trillium! My\nown granddaughter? Impossible! Dimdooly,\" Mr. President roared at his\nExcellency, \"what's this nonsense?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some loud creature is interfering,\" Madame President snapped with\nannoyance.\n  \n \n  \"Blasted fools still have the circuits crossed,\" Mr. President swore.\n\"Some silly female cackling now!\"\n  \n \n  The parties in the panels saw each other now. Each one's left hand on a\ndesk moved toward a big red button marked, ROCKETS.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" Mr. President said evenly. \"Another violation by your Earthmen.\"\n  \n \n  \"By your granddaughter, at least,\" Madame President replied coolly.\n  \n \n  \"An innocent child,\" Mr. President snapped, \"obviously kidnapped by\nthose two idiotic Earthmen there!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no, Grandpapa,\" Trillium said swiftly; \"I stole away all by\nmyself, and Mr. O'Rielly and Callahan have been very helpful.\"\n  \n \n  \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President's ear beards stood near straight up\nas he roared, \"You couldn't have stolen away by yourself! Trillium,\ntell the truth!\"\n  \n \n  \"Very well. Grandmamma told me how.\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_2]\nO'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her\nuntil she couldn't sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age\nwhere no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a\nbreath against woman's supremacy in all matters. That male character\ntrait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why\nO'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one's person, heard\nhimself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all\nthat bother to get out here!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're so kind. But I'm afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume! I'll drop a\nsuggestion in the Old Woman's box first chance I get.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're so thoughtful. And do you have bathing facilities?\"\n  \n \n  \"That door right there. Oh, let me open it for you!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence\nthat O'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for\nher.\n  \n \n  Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music\nin his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover\nwhen he'd been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who\nhad a jug to cheer one's parting with one's money.\n  \n \n  A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights\nflashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old\nbuzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\n  \n \n  When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well,\nwhat about that control?\"\n  \n \n  \"What control?\"\n  \n \n  \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, that little thing.\"\n  \n \n  Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O'Rielly\nsharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again?\nLemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll\nagain probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly said while bowing\ngracefully.\n  \n \n  \"Higher than a swacked skunk's tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then\nsnapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that\nBurner Chief Terrence Callahan's mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody's,\nwould be improved by knowledge of she who was in O'Rielly's shower now.\nNot that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary.\nOh, very quite!\n  \n \n  \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn't I tell you\nto shower the stink off yourself?

After he discovers Trillium, she uses his bathing facilities to wash herself of the stink from the burner room where she was stowing away. After Callahan enters the watch room and learns of Trillium’s presence, he encourages her to hide again because of Captain Hatwoody’s impending visit. She hides beneath O’Rielly’s bunk. After Captain Hatwoody and her guest, Ambassador Dimdooly, stumble upon Trillium, the captain demands that they all follow her to her office. In her office, she convenes a conference with the presidents of Earth and Venus. After Berta—Trillium’s grandmother, the wife of the current Venusian president, and Callahan’s former love interest—reveals herself as the new ruler of Venus, O’Rielly and Callahan are given a five-minute break and sent back to their former duties managing the burners below.", "The story takes place on a spacecraft led by the female Captain Hatwoody. The main settings are in O’Rielly’s bunk room, shower, burner room four, and the command center of the craft. It is described as quite a large ship with many rooms and crew. The craft is on a mission to deliver the Personal Ambassador to the President of Venus to Earth from the planet of Venus. The spacecraft is in transit during the story, and there are no settings on either of the planets themselves, only the ship.\n", "The setting of the story includes multiple areas of a spaceship, including one of its burner rooms, the watch room, bunk, locker, and shower of O’Rielly, and Captain Hatwoody’s office. The ship is in outer space, approaching but not yet within Earth’s orbit. Several other locations are described, either involving characters who are communicating remotely (the presidents of Earth and Venus talking to Captain Hatwoody from their offices on their respective planets via video panels), or describing past events (Callahan describing his adventures stowing away while on vacation and traveling to Venus). Several past events are also discussed that include Earth, Venus, and/or spacecrafts. The story is set over 1,000 years in the future. \n", "The story is set on an Earth spaceship in the future one thousand years after Earth completed its first successful flight to Venus. It specifically starts in Burnerman O’Rielly’s watch room outside burner room number four for which he is responsible. The ship is returning to Earth, and burner number four has a fusion control reading that is two points low. This can cause the ship to crash on landing. The ship has futuristic features including an electronic shower that can cleanse a person and his clothes in a matter of minutes and video conference calls. On the initial flight from Earth to Venus, the Earthmen discovered the beauty of the Venus women and immediately fell in love with them. They took some Venus women back to Earth, and men there abandoned everything, even their wives and families, to try to be with the Venus women. Earth women were angry at how the men acted and took control of the planet; they also sent all the Venus women back to their home planet. Now Earth and Venus trade with each other, but Earthmen and Venus women are not allowed to be together because doing so can spark a war between the two planets. Earth has a female president, and women hold all the positions of authority over men. Venus has a male president who is very traditional and does not agree with the women of Venus that their men need to be home for more than two weeks every year and spend the rest of their time fighting in wars. Venus men look down on Earthmen for being subservient to women."]}}

The fact is—the\nQornt fleets are indetectible!\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_6]\n\"Obviously Trillium's poor little brain has been drugged,\" His\nExcellency Dimdooly declared. \"Grandmamma Berta wouldn't know the first\nthing about such things!\"\n  \n \n  \"Impossible!\" Grandpapa President agreed. \"I've been married to her\nfor a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she's the finest\nrattle-brain I ever knew!\"\n  \n \n  \"She learned,\" Trillium stated emphatically, \"a hundred and twenty-five\nyears ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hundred twenty-five,\" Grandpapa president growled like a boiling\nvolcano. \"The year some Earthman....

Weren't you, Trillium dear?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. One of us stowing away was the only way we Venus women could bring\nour cause to the attention of Earth's President.

Now say it!\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_2]\nO'Rielly suddenly felt like turning her over his knee and whaling her\nuntil she couldn't sit for a year. This, mind you, he felt in an age\nwhere no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a\nbreath against woman's supremacy in all matters. That male character\ntrait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why\nO'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one's person, heard\nhimself saying in sympathetic outrage, \"A shame you had to go to all\nthat bother to get out here!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're so kind. But I'm afraid I became rather sticky and smelly in\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  \"They ought to cool the air in there with perfume!

Oh, let me open it for you!\"\n  \n \n  \"You're so sweet.\" Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence\nthat O'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for\nher.\n  \n \n  Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music\nin his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover\nwhen he'd been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who\nhad a jug to cheer one's parting with one's money.\n  \n \n  A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights\nflashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old\nbuzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.\n  \n \n  When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. \"Well,\nwhat about that control?\"\n  \n \n  \"What control?\"\n  \n \n  \"Your fusion control that got itself two points low!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, that little thing.\"\n  \n \n  Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O'Rielly\nsharply. \"Hey, you been wetting your whistle on that Venus vino again?\nLemme smell your breath! Bah. Loaded yourself full of chlorophyll\nagain probably. All right, stand aside whilst I see your burner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Charmed to, Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly said while bowing\ngracefully.\n  \n \n  \"Higher than a swacked skunk's tail again,\" Callahan muttered, then\nsnapped back over his shoulder, \"Use your shower!\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly stood considering his shower door. Somehow he doubted that\nBurner Chief Terrence Callahan's mood, or Captain Millicent Hatwoody's,\nwould be improved by knowledge of she who was in O'Rielly's shower now.\nNot that the dear stowaway was less than charming. Quite the contrary.\nOh, very quite!\n  \n \n  \"You rockhead!\" Only Callahan back from the burner. \"Didn't I tell you\nto shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman's taking a Venus bigwig\non tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks\nshe'll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she'll do anyway\nabout your fusion control!\"\n  \n \n  \"Burner Chief Callahan, sir,\" O'Rielly responded courteously, \"I have\nbeen thinking.\"\n  \n \n  \"With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for\nmyself here.\" Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O'Rielly's shower\ndoor.\n  \n \n  \"Venus dames,\" O'Rielly said dreamily, \"don't boss anything, do they?\"\n  \n \n  Callahan yelped like he'd been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.\n\"O'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?\"\nCallahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF\nposition; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not\nhave overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan's eyes rolled like the\ndevil was behind him with the fork ready. \"O'Rielly, open your big ears\nwhilst for your own good and mine I speak of certain matters.\n  \n \n  \"Thousand years ago, it was, the first flight reached Venus. Guys\ngot one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then\neverybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did\nit. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up\nthe shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or\nfamily—everything.\n  \n \n  \"Well, that's when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats\nwith knots in their tails. Before the guys who'd brought the Venus\ndames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to\npick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones\nback where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on\nEarth again there wouldn't be enough left of Venus to find with an\nelectron microscope.\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_4]\n\"Hah? What?\" Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and\nwas being slapped together again. \"O'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced\npirate, couldn't you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up,\nyou don't have to explain to me, but God help the whole universe if we\ndon't flimflam the Old Woman!\" With which ominous remark, rendered in\na zesty devil-may-care manner, however, Callahan threw himself into\nO'Rielly's shower.\n  \n \n  O'Rielly stood looking thoughtfully at lovely, womanly, exquisite\nTrillium. Just like that, O'Rielly felt as sparkling of mind as a\nspiral nebula. \"My locker!\" he crowed with inspiration and yanked open\nthe doors under his bunk. He glimpsed a black ditty bag, also the cap\nand coverall uniform of a baggage boy.\n  \n \n  \"I threw them in there before you came on duty before blast-off,\"\nTrillium explained. \"I knew the burner room would be warm.\"\n  \n \n  Trillium—with her shape—passing as a boy hustling bags through this\nship. O'Rielly chortled as he tucked her under his bunk. \"Now don't you\nworry about another thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I'm not,\" she assured him happily. \"Everything is going just the\nway Grandmamma knew it would!\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly's shower opened and Callahan, glowing like a young bucko,\nbounced onto the bunk. \"Well, did you hide her good this time? No,\ndon't tell me! I want to be surprised if the Old Woman ever finds her.\"\n  \n \n  \"If what old woman finds whom?\" a voice like thin ice crackling wanted\nto know.\n  \n \n  The watch room's door had opened. Wouldn't think the Old Woman was a\nday over seventy-five, let alone near two hundred. Cut of her uniform\nprobably lent a helping hand or three to the young snap of her figure.\nFrosty blue of fancy hair-do, she was, though, and icy of eye as she\nlooked at O'Rielly and Callahan still lolling on the bunk.\n  \n \n  Her voice was an iceberg exploding. \"At attention!\"\n  \n \n  Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly\nerect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully\nrobed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap\nlesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed\nfrom his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle\nof two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.\n  \n \n  She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. \"Mr. Callahan, I asked\nyou a question, did I not?\"\n  \n \n  \"Believe you did, ma'am,\" Callahan responded cheerfully. \"And the\nanswer is, ma'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly and me was\ndiscussing—ah—matrimony, ma'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly\nhere is considering it, ma'am.\"\n  \n \n  Wasn't too bad a fib. The more O'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more\nideas he got of doing things he'd never dreamt of before in his life.\nYes, ma'am!\n  \n \n  \"Wasting your time talking nonsense!\" Old Woman's look was fit to\nfreeze O'Rielly's brain, then she gave Callahan the look. \"I sent you\ndown here to find the answer to that fusion control slippage!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you'll have the best answer you ever heard of before long, ma'am!\"\nCallahan assured her heartily. \"The subject of nonsense—I mean,\nwomen—merely chanced to arise whilst we was scientifically analyzing\nthe control phenomenon, ma'am. Naturally I offered this innocent young\nBurnerman the benefit of me long years of experience. Why,\" Callahan\nsaid with a jaunty laugh, \"dames mean nothing to me. Indeed 'twouldn't\nbother me none if there wasn't one of the things left in the world!\nPresent company excepted, of course,\" Callahan hastened to say with a\ncourtly bow.\n  \n \n  \"Stay at attention!\" Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan's face,\nthen in O'Rielly's vicinity. \"Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,\"\nshe muttered through her teeth, \"if it is that vino.\" Something\nhorrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there\nagain. \"Apprentice Burnerman, don't you know what your shower is for?\nThen use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this\nburner!\" She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. \"Care to join\nme, Your Excellency?\"\n  \n \n  \"May as well.\" His Excellency glanced at O'Rielly and Callahan much as\nhe might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female\never told any Venus man what to do.\n  \n \n  The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two\nsteps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly\nblowing her gaskets completely, O'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the\ndoor, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed\nof person and clothes. By time he finished, the Old Woman and His\nExcellency were already coming out of the burner room, dripping with\nsweat.\n  \n \n  Old Woman opened the shower with her customary commanding air. \"You\nfirst, Your Excellency.\"\n  \n \n  \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger,\n\"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\"\n  \n \n  No Earth dame ever admitted any guy was even equal to any female. Old\nWoman, a prime symbol of her gender's superiority, whipped a razor edge\nonto her own words. \"Facilities of the Captain's quarters are more\nsatisfactory.\"\n  \n \n  \"No more so than those of the Ambassadorial Suite.\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_1]\nIMAGE OF SPLENDOR\n  \n \n  By LU KELLA\n  \n \n \n   From Venus to Earth, and all the way between,\n    \n   it was a hell of a world for men ... and\n    \n   Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly particularly.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The intercom roared fit to blow O'Rielly back to Venus. \"Burner Four!\"\n  \n \n  \"On my way, sir!\"\n  \n \n  At the first flash of red on the bank of meters Apprentice Burnerman\nO'Rielly had slammed the safety helmet on his head; he was already\nthrowing open the lock to the burner room. The hot, throbbing rumble\nwhipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of\nthe universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one\nchance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The\nthrobbing rumble changed tone.\n  \n \n  Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.\n\"Well, Mr. O'Rielly?\"\n  \n \n  \"Fusion control two points low, sir.\"\n  \n \n  O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old\nBurner Chief demanded hoarsely, \"Didn't you lock them controls before\nblast-off?\"\n  \n \n  \"If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting,\" O'Rielly\nanswered from his own angry bewilderment, \"the error would have\nregistered before blast-off—wouldn't it, sir?\"\n  \n \n  \"So a control reset itself in flight, hey?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know yet, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!\"\n  \n \n  The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on\nthis ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In a\nhundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O'Rielly\nin pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one\nhad moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from\nEarth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven\nthrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all\naboard gone in a churning cloud.\n  \n \n  Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of\nthe thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't any\nmore? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch\nroom. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed\nand a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the Burner\nChief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient\nofficers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watch\nroom. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it.\nBy now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably\ninquired what was in charge of Burner Four.\n  \n \n  Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed\nmouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Rielly\nsaw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of\nsome God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And\nhis brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt\nthat way.\n  \n \n  She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman\neither. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which\nO'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!\n  \n \n  \"I was in your burner room.\" Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend\nof loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. \"I\ncouldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door.\nSo I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there,\nnaturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back was turned\nresetting the control.\"\n\n[Chapter: IMAGE_OF_SPLENDOR_7]\nDimdooly—the mighty, the lordly, who had sneered at the sight of mere\nEarthmen kowtowing to a mere woman—swelled up fit to blow his gaskets,\nthen all the gas went out of him. His ear beards, however, still had\nenough zip left to flutter like butterflies. \"Yes, Trillium dear. I\nlove only you. Please marry me at your earliest convenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, Grandmamma,\" Trillium said with a highly self-satisfied air, \"it\nworks. And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we\nVenus women had our own men in our power.\"\n  \n \n  \"Those crewmen there,\" Grandmamma President said, \"seem to be proof\nenough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth's\ntranquility.\"\n  \n \n  Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden.\nWorse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked\naway from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away\nfrom Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest\nheadache in history.\n  \n \n  \"Hmmmm, yes,\" Madame President of Earth observed. \"Reactions agree\nperfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been\nconducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame\nPresident of Venus, congratulations on your victory!\n  \n \n  \"Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too! We shall be delighted to\nreceive an Ambassadoress to discuss a new trade treaty at your earliest\nconvenience.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thank you for cancelling the old trade agreements at the psychological\nmoment,\" Grandmamma President said cordially. \"What with the\ncommunications mixup, we managed to have the scenes on these panels\nbroadcast throughout all Venus. When the rug went out from under the\ntop man, the tide really turned in our favor. Now, Trillium, you take\nover Dimmy's credentials.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Ambassadorial Suite, too,\" Madame President of Earth said\ngraciously. \"Anything else now, Berta?\"\n  \n \n  \"I should like,\" Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, \"that\nMr. O'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our\nrevolution better than they knew.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. \"No\ndoubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs\nbest.\"\n  \n \n  The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged\nDimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O'Rielly and Callahan.\nEspecially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his\nold conniving brain. \"I award the pair of you five minutes leisure\nbefore returning to your stations.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, well,\" O'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond\nearshot, \"could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.\"\n  \n \n  \"What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of\nSaturn? Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the\ncrows for breakfast.\" Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a little\ngrin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.\n  \n \n  \"You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,\" O'Rielly\nsaid in sudden thought. \"If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why\ndid Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?\"\n  \n \n  \"Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time,\" Callahan mumbled,\nlike to himself, \"they'd of found out the answer centuries ago.

For example, when Hatwoody offers Dimdooly the shower first after inspecting the burner room, he responds with a pointed remark:\n   - ##begin_quote## \"My dear Captain,\" His Excellency replied like a smoothly drawn dagger, \"always the lesser gender enjoys precedence.\" ##end_quote##\n   This shows Dimdooly's condescension and the competitive dynamic between them.\n\n2. **Competing Authority During Crisis:**  \nAs the situation with Trillium escalates, both assert their authority, each claiming the right to handle the crisis according to their planet's interests:\n   - ##begin_quote## \"May I remind His Excellency,\" the Old Woman snapped, \"that I represent Earth and her dominion of space gained by right of original flight!\" ##end_quote##\n   - ##begin_quote## \"May I remind the Captain,\" His Excellency declared fit to be heard back to his planet, \"that I am the Personal Ambassador of the President of Venus and this thing can mean war!\" ##end_quote##\n   These quotes highlight their adversarial relationship and the high stakes of their negotiation.\n\n3. **Symbolic of Interplanetary and Gender Conflict:**  \nTheir interactions are not just personal but emblematic of the larger conflict between Earth and Venus, and between the sexes. Their sniping and jockeying for superiority mirror the broader societal tensions that the story ultimately resolves through the women's revolution.\n\n##Answer: Captain Hatwoody and Ambassador Dimdooly have a tense, adversarial relationship characterized by mutual condescension and rivalry, each representing their planet's (and gender's) interests during the interplanetary crisis. Their exchanges are laced with snark and symbolic of the broader gender and political tensions between Earth and Venus."}], "metadata": {"id": "24", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["Captain Hatwoody is the commander of the ship that ferries between Earth and Venus. She is a stern, efficient Earth woman with a vocal disdain for men. Behind her back, the men of her crew refer to her as “the Old Woman.” Ambassador Dimdooly is a Venusian who works as the right-hand man of the President of Venus. Similar to Hatwoody’s disgust for men, Ambassador Dimdooly harbors a deep-seated misogyny. Both characters’ innate sexism is reflected in the social orders of their individual planets and are the result of over one-hundred years of conflict. Captain Hatwoody plays gracious host to Ambassador Dimdooly when he visits the ship, even referring to him as “Excellency.” However, their tensions are revealed when together they inspect Burner Four after visiting O’Rielly in his watch room. They each make snarky comments to each other about the inferiority of the others’ respective gender. Their attitudes are reflected later during the confrontational meeting between the presidents of Earth and Venus in Captain Hatwoody’s office. These two characters’ interactions are essential in highlighting the gender conflict that explodes at the story’s end when both Earth and Venusian women solidify their rule over their respective planets.\n", "The male staff on the ship call Captain Hatwoody “Old Woman” and she is described in language that suggests she is cold and unfeeling. This appears to be a product of their failing to recognize her power as a superior and their discomfort with having a woman in charge. \nAmbassador Dimdooly is the Personal Ambassador to the President of Venus. He speaks down to the Captain as a “lesser gender”. After the discovery of Trillium he bades to handle it himself, because he knows that she is the granddaughter of the President and that her stowing away could be cause for war.\nThe Captain and the Ambassador have tense interactions. The Ambassador does not think the Captain should be in a position of power as a woman and looks down upon the male staff on the ship that stand at her command. \n", "The relationship between Captain Hatwoody and Ambassador Dimdooly is a tense professional relationship between two high-ranking officials from societies with disparate cultural values and gender norms. Dimdooly is from Venus, where men are in control of the government and considered the dominant sex, and Hatwoody is from Earth, where the opposite is true. Dimdooly is an Ambassador being shown around the ship of which Hatwoody is the captain. Dimdooly appears to be disgusted at the male crew members taking orders from a woman, and he and the captain disagree about who should get “precedence” in terms of who will shower first and where based on which of them has the superior status. Their interactions are characterized by an icy civility throughout the story. ", "Captain Hatwoody is giving Ambassador Dimdooly a tour of Earth’s ship. When Hatwoody orders Callahan and O’Rielly to attention, Dimdooly sneers at the sight of the two men being subservient to a woman. He acts as if he would never allow a woman to tell him what to do. He also refers to Hatwoody as “the lesser gender,” which shows that he considers himself superior to women. When Trillium is discovered on board, and Hatwoody starts to handle the situation, he tells Hatwoody to “shut up” and states that he will take care of the matter since he is the “Personal Ambassador of the President of Venus” and that the incident can lead to war between the two planets. When Berta takes over the presidency for Venus, Trillium orders Dimdooly to stop beating around the bush with her and say what he means, so Dimdooly confesses he loves Trillium and asks her to marry him at her earliest convenience. Trillium then states that Earthmen have no power over Venus women when Venus women have control over their Venus men."]}}

Jack pulled back the diamond-patterned quilt and blinked\nthe sleep from his eyes. He expected his mind to be busy wondering\nabout Kesserich and his wife—things said and half said last night—but\nfound instead that his thoughts swung instantly to Mary Alice Pope, as\nif to a farthest island in a world of people.\n  \n \n  Downstairs, the house was empty. After a long look at the cabinet—he\nfelt behind it, but the key was gone—he hurried down to the\nwaterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an\nafterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers.\n  \n \n  The sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the\n   \n   Annie O.\n   \n  There\nwas eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the\nmast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous\nwith faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir.\n  \n \n  After the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky\nspine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures\nstruck an uncomfortable chord in his memory.\n  \n \n  This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the\ninnocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd\nbrought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence\nwhen he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it.\n  \n \n  He hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the\nsame time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him.\n  \n \n  The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to\nspeak in a hushed, hurried voice. \"You must go away at once and never\ncome back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've\nbeen watching for you all morning.\"\n  \n \n  He tossed the newspapers over the fence. \"You don't have to read\nthem now,\" he told her. \"Just look at the datelines and a few of the\nheadlines.\"\n  \n \n  When she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling. She\ntried unsuccessfully to speak.\n  \n \n  \"Listen to me,\" he said. \"You've been the victim of a scheme to make\nyou believe you were born around 1916 instead of 1933, and that it's\n1933 now instead of 1951.

It was\nagonizingly slow, but faster than climbing down. He ripped the door\nback at the exit deck. Men were dashing in, stumbling around in\nconfusion. But someone was taking over now—one of the crew women. The\njeeps were lining up. One, at the front, was stuttering into life, and\nGwayne dashed for it as the exit port slid back.\n  \n \n  There was no time for suits or helmets. The air on the planet was\nirritating and vile smelling, but it could be breathed. He leaped to\nthe seat, to see that the driver was Doctor Barker. At a gesture, the\njeep rolled down the ramp, grinding its gears into second as it picked\nup speed. The other two followed.\n  \n \n  There was no sign of the cadets at first. Then Gwayne spotted them;\nsurrounded by the menacing horde. Seen from here, the things looked\nhorrible in a travesty of manhood.\n  \n \n  The huge leader suddenly waved and pointed toward the jeeps that were\nracing toward him. He made a fantastic leap backwards. Others swung\nabout, two of them grabbing up the cadets. The jeep was doing twenty\nmiles an hour now, but the horde began to increase the distance, in\nspite of the load of the two struggling boys! The creatures dived\ndownward into lower ground, beginning to disappear into the mists.\n  \n \n  \"Follow the blobs,\" Gwayne yelled. He realized now he'd been a fool to\nleave his suit; the radio would have let him keep in contact with the\nkids. But it was too late to go back.\n  \n \n  The blobs danced after the horde. Barker bounced the jeep downward into\na gorge. Somewhere the man had learned to drive superlatively; but he\nhad to slow as the fog thickened lower down.\n  \n \n  Then it cleared to show the mob of creatures doubling back on their own\ntrail to confuse the pursuers.\n  \n \n  There was no time to stop. The jeep plowed through them. Gwayne had a\nglimpse of five-foot bodies tumbling out of the way. Monstrously coarse\nfaces were half hidden by thick hair. A spear crunched against the\nwindshield from behind, and Gwayne caught it before it could foul the\nsteering wheel. It had a wickedly beautiful point of stone.\n  \n \n  The creatures vanished as Barker fought to turn to follow them. The\nother jeeps were coming up, by the sound of their motors, but too late\nto help. They'd have to get to the group with the cadets in a hurry or\nthe horde would all vanish in the uneven ground, hidden by the fog.\n  \n \n  A blob dropped down, almost touching Gwayne.\n  \n \n  He threw up an instinctive hand. There was a tingling as the creature\nseemed to pass around it. It lifted a few inches and drifted off.\n  \n \n  Abruptly, Barker's foot ground at the brake. Gwayne jolted forward\nagainst the windshield, just as he made out the form of the eight-foot\nleader. The thing was standing directly ahead of him, a cadet on each\nshoulder.\n  \n \n  The wheels locked and the jeep slid protestingly forward. The creature\nleaped back. But Gwayne was out of the jeep before it stopped, diving\nfor the figure. It dropped the boys with a surprised grunt.\n\n[Chapter: The_Happy_Castaway_3]\nHe paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward\nthem from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was\nbarefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around\nher sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her\nbrown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table\ncloth at one time in its history.\n  \n \n  \"A man!\" she breathed. \"By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a\nman!\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't let him get away!\" cried Ann.\n  \n \n  \"Hilda!\" the brunette shrieked. \"A man! It's a man!\"\n  \n \n  A third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off\nwarily.\n  \n \n  Ann Clotilde cried in anguish: \"Don't let him get away!\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way\nhe had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the\ncanyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the\nbend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him.\n  \n \n  Jonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer\nweight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up\nbodily, started up the canyon chanting: \"\n   \n   He was a rocket riding daddy\nfrom Mars.\n   \n  \" He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago.\n  \n \n  Jonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the\nspaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had\nbeen broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of\nhis left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy,\ntough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from\nmortification.\n  \n \n  He said, \"Put me down. I'll walk.\"\n  \n \n  \"You won't try to get away?\" said Ann.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being\nheld aloft by four barbarous young women.\n  \n \n  \"Let him down,\" said Ann. \"We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a\nbreak.\"\n  \n \n  Jonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between\ntwo husky females, who ogled him shamelessly. He was amazed at the ease\nwith which they had carried him. He was six feet three and no light\nweight. He thought enviously of the centaurs, free to gallop across the\nplains. He wished he was a centaur.\n  \n \n  The trail left the canyon, struggled up the precipitate walls. Jonathan\npicked his way gingerly, hugged the rock. \"Don't be afraid,\" advised\none of his captors. \"Just don't look down.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm not afraid,\" said Jonathan hotly. To prove it he trod the narrow\nledge with scorn. His foot struck a pebble. Both feet went out from\nunder him. He slithered halfway over the edge. For one sickening moment\nhe thought he was gone, then Ann grabbed him by the scruff of his neck,\nhauled him back to safety. He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a\nrope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way to the top\nlike a baby on a leash. He was too crestfallen to resent it.\n  \n \n  The trail came out on a high ridge. They paused on a bluff overlooking\nthe prairie.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" cried Ann pointing over the edge.\n  \n \n  A half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first,\nJonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up\nthey resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to\nhis own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses.\n  \n \n  \"Centaurs!\" Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes.\n\n[Chapter: THE_LOST_TRIBES_OF_VENUS_1]\nTHE LOST TRIBES OF VENUS\n  \n \n  By ERIK FENNEL\n  \n \n \n   On mist-shrouded Venus, where hostile\n    \n   swamp meets hostile sea ... there did\n    \n   Barry Barr—Earthman transmuted—swap\n    \n   his Terran heritage for the deep dark\n    \n   waters of Tana; for the strangely\n    \n   beautiful Xintel of the blue-brown skin.\n   \n \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories May 1954.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Evil luck brought the meteorite to those particular space-time\ncoordinates as Number Four rode the downhill spiral toward Venus. The\nfootball-sized chunk of nickel-iron and rock overtook the ship at a\nrelative speed of only a few hundred miles per hour and passed close\nenough to come within the tremendous pseudo-gravatic fields of the\nidling drivers.\n  \n \n  It swerved into a paraboloid course, following the flux lines, and was\ndragged directly against one of the three projecting nozzles. Energy\nof motion was converted to heat and a few meteoric fragments fused\nthemselves to the nonmetallic tube casing.\n  \n \n  In the jet room the positronic line accelerator for that particular\ndriver fouled under the intolerable overload, and the backsurge sent\nsearing heat and deadly radiation blasting through the compartment\nbefore the main circuit breakers could clack open.\n  \n \n  The bellow of the alarm horn brought Barry Barr fully awake, shattering\na delightfully intimate dream of the dark haired girl he hoped to see\nagain soon in Venus Colony. As he unbuckled his bunk straps and started\naft at a floating, bounding run his weightlessness told him instantly\nthat Number Four was in free fall with dead drivers.\n  \n \n  Red warning lights gleamed wickedly above the safety-locked jet\nroom door, and Nick Podtiaguine, the air machines specialist, was\nmanipulating the emergency controls with Captain Reno at his elbow. One\nby one the crew crowded into the corridor and watched in tense silence.\n  \n \n  The automatic lock clicked off as the jet room returned to habitable\nconditions, and at Captain Reno's gesture two men swung the door open.\nQuickly the commander entered the blasted jet room. Barry Barr was\nclose behind him.\n  \n \n  Robson Hind, jet chief of Four and electronics expert for Venus Colony,\nhung back until others had gone in first.

By the time the other two arrive, Jack seems somewhat despondent based on what Sanderson has told him about the difficulties and improbability of the mission. Jack is assigned to flank Peter on the mission, along with Mikuta, but agrees to switch positions with McIvers and pull the sledges instead.

It did! Immediately he was surrounded by\nactivity. He heard the roar of the crashing orange breakers, he tasted\nthe dew of acid that floated from the spray, and he saw his new friends\ncontinue the actions which he had stopped while back in the forest.\n  \n \n  He knew, too, that at this moment, in the forest, the little brook\npicked up its flow where it had left off, the purple clouds resumed\ntheir leeward journey up the valley, and the bees continued their\npollen-gathering without having missed a single stroke of their\ndelicate wings. The brook, the clouds, and the insects had not been\ninterrupted in the least; their respective tasks had been performed\nwith continuing sureness. It was time itself that Purnie had stopped,\nnot the world around him.\n  \n \n  He scampered around the rockpile and down the sandy cliff to meet the\ntripons who, to him, had just come to life.\n  \n \n  \"I can stand on my head!\" He set down his lunch and balanced himself\nbottoms-up while his legs pawed the air in an effort to hold him in\nposition. He knew it was probably the worst head-stand he had ever\ndone, for he felt weak and dizzy. Already time-stopping had left its\nmark on his strength. But his spirits ran on unchecked.\n  \n \n  The tripon thought Purnie's feat was superb. It stopped munching long\nenough to give him a salutory wag of its rump before returning to its\nrepast.\n  \n \n  Purnie ran from pillar to post, trying to see and do everything at\nonce. He looked around to greet the flock of spora, but they had glided\nto a spot further along the shore. Then, bouncing up to the first of\nthe two-legged animals, he started to burst forth with his habitual \"Hi\nthere!\" when he heard them making sounds of their own.\n  \n \n  \"... will be no limit to my operations now, Benson. This planet makes\nseventeen. Seventeen planets I can claim as my own!\"\n  \n \n  \"My, my. Seventeen planets. And tell me, Forbes, just what the hell are\nyou going to do with them—mount them on the wall of your den back in\nSan Diego?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hi there, wanna play?\" Purnie's invitation got nothing more than\nstartled glance from the animals who quickly returned to their chatter.\nHe scampered up the beach, picked up his lunch, and ran back to them,\ntagging along at their heels. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n  \n \n  \"Benson, you'd better tell your men back there to stop gawking at\nthe scenery and get to work. Time is money. I didn't pay for this\nexpedition just to give your flunkies a vacation.\"\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_6]\nPurnie saw one of the animals hovering around him with a little box.\nThankful for the attention, he stood on his head. \"Can you do this?\"\nHe was overjoyed at the reaction. They all started making wonderful\nnoises, and he felt most satisfied.\n  \n \n  \"Stand back, Captain! Here's the source right here! This little\nchuck-walla's hotter than a plutonium pile!\"\n  \n \n  \"Let me see that, Miles. Well, I'll be damned! Now what do you\nsuppose—\"\n  \n \n  By now they had formed a widening circle around him, and he was hard\nput to think of an encore. He gambled on trying a brand new trick: he\nstood on one leg.\n  \n \n  \"Benson, I must have that animal! Put him in a box.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now wait a minute, Forbes. Universal Law forbids—\"\n  \n \n  \"This is my planet and I am the law.

You are responsible to me, and\nwhat's more, you are on my property. Put him in a box.\"\n  \n \n  Purnie was tired. First the time-stopping, then this. While this day\nhad brought more fun and excitement than he could have hoped for,\nthe strain was beginning to tell. He lay in the center of the circle\nhappily exhausted, hoping that his friends would show him some of their\nown tricks.\n  \n \n  He didn't have to wait long. The animals forming the circle stepped\nback and made way for two others who came through carrying a box.\nPurnie sat up to watch the show.\n  \n \n  \"Hell, Captain, why don't I just pick him up? Looks like he has no\nintention of running away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Better not, Cabot. Even though you're shielded, no telling what\npowers the little fella has. Play it safe and use the rope.\"\n  \n \n  \"I swear he knows what we're saying. Look at those eyes.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right, careful now with that line.\"\n  \n \n  \"Come on, baby. Here you go. That's a boy!\"\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_5]\nWhen the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the\nfirst two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the\nbase of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\n  \n \n  \"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high\nto carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will\nslide down on top of us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well—that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be\nsolid. It's got to stand at least—\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with\nthe flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a\nflag.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set\ndown by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it\nrepresents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags\nis the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it\nsentiment if you will.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?\nWhat I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow\nsystem so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own\nthe people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!\nIt's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your\nspace ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money\ninto a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from\nthirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\"\n  \n \n  When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in\nthe strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and\nas they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to\nhimself, content to be in their company.\n  \n \n  He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see\nthe remainder of the group running toward them.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the\nscintillometer.

What with red-spot\n   \n  fever, talking cockatoos and flagpole trees,\n   \n  I was running in circles—especially since\n   \n  Grannie became twins every now and then.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Spring 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  We had left the offices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  three days ago, Earth\ntime, and now as the immense disc of Jupiter flamed across the sky,\nentered the outer limits of the Baldric. Grannie Annie strode in the\nlead, her absurd long-skirted black dress looking as out of place in\nthis desert as the trees.\n  \n \n  Flagpole trees. They rose straight up like enormous cat-tails, with\nonly a melon-shaped protuberance at the top to show they were a form of\nvegetation. Everything else was blanketed by the sand and the powerful\nwind that blew from all quarters.\n  \n \n  As we reached the first of those trees, Grannie came to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"This is the Baldric all right. If my calculations are right, we've hit\nit at its narrowest spot.\"\n  \n \n  Ezra Karn took a greasy pipe from his lips and spat. \"It looks like the\nrest of this God-forsaken moon,\" he said, \"'ceptin for them sticks.\"\n  \n \n  Xartal, the Martian illustrator, said nothing. He was like that,\ntaciturn, speaking only when spoken to.\n  \n \n  He could be excused this time, however, for this was only our third day\non Jupiter's Eighth Moon, and the country was still strange to us.\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_11]\nPurnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\n  \n \n  He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks,\nwhere he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons\nhe saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and\nthree, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the\ncurving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far\nbehind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\n  \n \n  \"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's possible, but we're not.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wish I could be sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"See Forbes up ahead there? What do you think of him?\"\n  \n \n  \"I still can't believe it.\"\n  \n \n  \"He'll never be the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell me something. What was the most unusual thing you noticed back\nthere?\"\n  \n \n  \"You must be kidding, sir. Why, the way those logs were off of us\nsuddenly—\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, of course. But I mean beside that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess I was kind of busy. You know, scared and mixed up.\"\n  \n \n  \"But didn't you notice our little pop-eyed friend?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, him. I'm afraid not, Captain. I—I guess I was thinking mostly of\nmyself.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hmmm. If I could only be sure I saw him. If only someone else saw him\ntoo.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid I don't follow you, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, damn it all, you know that Forbes took a pot shot at him. Got\nhim in the leg. That being the case, why would the fuzzy little devil\ncome back to his tormentors—back to us—when we were trapped under\nthose logs?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I guess as long as we were trapped, he figured we couldn't do\nhim any more harm.... I'm sorry, that was a stupid answer. I guess I'm\nstill a little shaky.\"\n  \n \n  \"Forget it. Look, you go ahead to the ship and make ready for take-off.\nI'll join you in a few minutes. I think I'll go back and look around.\nYou know. Make sure we haven't left anyone.\"\n  \n \n  \"No need to do that. They're all ahead of us. I've checked.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's my responsibility, Cabot, not yours. Now go on.\"\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_10]\nHis friends came to life. The first one he saw stir lay on his stomach\nand pounded his fists on the beach. A flood of relief settled over\nPurnie as sounds came from the animal.\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter with me? Somebody tell me! Am I nuts? Miles! Schick!\nWhat's happening?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm coming, Rhodes! Heaven help us, man—I saw it, too.

Those logs are so old\nthey're petrified. The whole bunch of us couldn't lift one. It would\ntake super-human energy to move one of those things.\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't seen anything super-human. Those ostriches down there are so\nbusy eating seaweed—\"\n  \n \n  \"All right, let's bear a hand here with the others. Some of them can't\nwalk.

Hee-hee!\"\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_8]\nWhen Purnie started time again, the animal with the noose stood in\nopen-mouthed disbelief as the rope fell harmlessly to the sand—on the\nspot where Purnie had been standing.\n  \n \n  \"My God, he's—he's gone.\"\n  \n \n  Then another of the animals, the one with the smoking thing in his\nhand, ran a few steps toward the noose, stopped and gaped at the rope.\n\"All right, you people, what's going on here? Get him in that box. What\ndid you do with him?\"\n  \n \n  The resumption of time meant nothing at all to those on the beach, for\nto them time had never stopped. The only thing they could be sure of\nwas that at one moment there had been a fuzzy creature hopping around\nin front of them, and the next moment he was gone.\n  \n \n  \"Is he invisible, Captain? Where is he?\"\n  \n \n  \"Up there, Captain! On those rocks. Isn't that him?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n  \n \n  \"Benson, I'm holding you personally responsible for this! Now that\nyou've botched it up, I'll bring him down my own way.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just a minute, Forbes, let me think. There's something about that\nfuzzy little devil that we should.... Forbes! I warned you about that\ngun!\"\n  \n \n  Purnie moved across the top of the rockpile for a last look at his\nfriends. His weight on the end of the first log started the slide.\nSlowly at first, the giant pencils began cascading down the short\ndistance to the sand. Purnie fell back onto solid ground, horrified at\nthe spectacle before him. The agonizing screams of the animals below\nfilled him with hysteria.\n  \n \n  The boulders caught most of them as they stood ankle-deep in the surf.\nOthers were pinned down on the sand.\n  \n \n  \"I didn't mean it!\" Purnie screamed. \"I'm sorry! Can't you hear?\" He\nhopped back and forth near the edge of the rise, torn with panic and\nshame. \"Get up! Please get up!\" He was horrified by the moans reaching\nhis ears from the beach. \"You're getting all wet! Did you hear me?\nPlease get up.\" He was choked with rage and sorrow. How could he have\ndone this? He wanted his friends to get up and shake themselves off,\ntell him it was all right. But it was beyond his power to bring it\nabout.\n  \n \n  The lapping tide threatened to cover those in the orange surf.\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_2]\nWhen he smelled an acid sweetness that told him the ocean was not far\noff, his pulse quickened in anticipation. Rather than spoil what was\nclearly going to be a perfect day, he chose to ignore the fact that he\nhad been forbidden to use time-stopping as a convenience for journeying\nfar from home. He chose to ignore the oft-repeated statement that an\nhour of time-stopping consumed more energy than a week of foot-racing.\nHe chose to ignore the negative maxim that \"small children who stop\ntime without an adult being present, may not live to regret it.\"\n  \n \n  He chose, instead, to picture the beaming praise of family and friends\nwhen they learned of his brave journey.\n  \n \n  The journey was long, the clock stood still. He stopped long enough to\ngather some fruit that grew along the path. It would serve as his lunch\nduring this day of promise. With it under his arm he bounded along a\ndozen more steps, then stopped abruptly in his tracks.\n  \n \n  He found himself atop a rocky knoll, overlooking the mighty sea!\n  \n \n  He was so overpowered by the vista before him that his \"Hurrah!\" came\nout as a weak squeak. The ocean lay at the ready, its stilled waves\nawaiting his command to resume their tidal sweep. The breakers along\nthe shoreline hung in varying stages of disarray, some having already\nexploded into towering white spray while others were poised in smooth\norange curls waiting to start that action.\n  \n \n  And there were new friends everywhere! Overhead, a flock of spora were\nfrozen in a steep glide, preparatory to a beach landing. Purnie had\nheard of these playful creatures many times. Today, with his brothers\nin school, he would have the pets all to himself. Further down the\nbeach was a pair of two-legged animals poised in mid-step, facing\nthe spot where Purnie now stood. Some distance behind them were eight\nmore, each of whom were motionless in a curious pose of interrupted\nanimation. And down in the water, where the ocean ran itself into thin\nnothingness upon the sand, he saw standing here and there the comical\ntripons, those three-legged marine buffoons who made handsome careers\nof munching seaweed.\n  \n \n  \"Hi there!\" Purnie called. When he got no reaction, he remembered that\nhe himself was \"dead\" to the living world: he was still in a zone of\ntime-stopping, on the inside looking out. For him, the world would\ncontinue to be a tableau of mannikins until he resumed time.\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_4]\nThe animals stopped so suddenly that Purnie nearly tangled himself in\ntheir heels.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Forbes, just hold it a minute. Listen to me. Sure, it's\nyour money that put us here; it's your expedition all the way. But you\nhired me to get you here with the best crew on earth, and that's just\nwhat I've done. My job isn't over yet. I'm responsible for the safety\nof the men while we're here, and for the safe trip home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Precisely. And since you're responsible, get 'em working. Tell 'em to\nbring along the flag. Look at the damn fools back there, playing in the\nocean with a three-legged ostrich!\"\n  \n \n  \"Good God, man, aren't you human? We've only been on this planet twenty\nminutes! Naturally they want to look around. They half expected to find\nwild animals or worse, and here we are surrounded by quaint little\ncreatures that run up to us like we're long-lost brothers. Let the men\nlook around a minute or two before we stake out your claim.\"\n  \n \n  \"Bah! Bunch of damn children.\"\n  \n \n  As Purnie followed along, a leg shot out at him and missed. \"Benson,\nwill you get this bug-eyed kangaroo away from me!\" Purnie shrieked with\njoy at this new frolic and promptly stood on his head. In this position\nhe got an upside down view of them walking away.\n  \n \n  He gave up trying to stay with them. Why did they move so fast, anyway?\nWhat was the hurry? As he sat down and began eating his lunch, three\nmore of the creatures came along making excited noises, apparently\ntrying to catch up to the first two. As they passed him, he held out\nhis lunch. \"Want some?\" No response.\n  \n \n  Playing held more promise than eating. He left his lunch half eaten and\nwent down to where they had stopped further along the beach.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Benson, sir! Miles has detected strong radiation in the\nvicinity. He's trying to locate it now.\"\n  \n \n  \"There you are, Forbes. Your new piece of real estate is going to make\nyou so rich that you can buy your next planet. That'll make eighteen, I\nbelieve.\"\n  \n \n  \"Radiation, bah! We've found low-grade ore on every planet I've\ndiscovered so far, and this one'll be no different. Now how about that\nflag? Let's get it up, Benson. And the cornerstone, and the plaque.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right, lads. The sooner we get Mr. Forbes's pennant raised and his\nclaim staked out, the sooner we can take time to look around. Lively\nnow!\"\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_7]\nPurnie took in these sounds with perplexed concern. He sensed the\nimploring quality of the creature with the rope, but he didn't know\nwhat he was supposed to do. He cocked his head to one side as he\nwiggled in anticipation.\n  \n \n  He saw the noose spinning down toward his head, and, before he knew\nit, he had scooted out of the circle and up the sandy beach. He was\nsurprised at himself for running away. Why had he done it? He wondered.\nNever before had he felt this fleeting twinge that made him want to\nprotect himself.\n  \n \n  He watched the animals huddle around the box on the beach, their\nattention apparently diverted to something else. He wished now that he\nhad not run away; he felt he had lost his chance to join in their fun.\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" He ran over to his half-eaten lunch, picked it up, and ran back\ninto the little crowd. \"I've got my lunch, want some?\"\n  \n \n  The party came to life once more. His friends ran this way and that,\nand at last Purnie knew that the idea was to get him into the box.\nHe picked up the spirit of the tease, and deliberately ran within a\nfew feet of the lead box, then, just as the nearest pursuer was about\nto push him in, he sidestepped onto safer ground. Then he heard a\ndeafening roar and felt a warm, wet sting in one of his legs.\n  \n \n  \"Forbes, you fool! Put away that gun!\"\n  \n \n  \"There you are, boys. It's all in knowing how. Just winged him, that's\nall. Now pick him up.\"\n  \n \n  The pang in his leg was nothing: Purnie's misery lay in his confusion.\nWhat had he done wrong? When he saw the noose spinning toward him\nagain, he involuntarily stopped time. He knew better than to use this\npower carelessly, but his action now was reflex. In that split second\nfollowing the sharp sting in his leg, his mind had grasped in all\ndirections to find an acceptable course of action. Finding none, it had\nordered the stoppage of time.\n  \n \n  The scene around him became a tableau once more. The noose hung\nmotionless over his head while the rest of the rope snaked its way in\ntransverse waves back to one of the two-legged animals. Purnie dragged\nhimself through the congregation, whimpering from his inability to\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  As he worked his way past one creature after another, he tried at first\nto not look them in the eye, for he felt sure he had done something\nwrong. Then he thought that by sneaking a glance at them as he passed,\nhe might see a sign pointing to their purpose. He limped by one who had\nin his hand a small shiny object that had been emitting smoke from one\nend; the smoke now billowed in lifeless curls about the animal's head.\nHe hobbled by another who held a small box that had previously made a\nhissing sound whenever Purnie was near. These things told him nothing.\nBefore starting his climb up the knoll, he passed a tripon which, true\nto its reputation, was comical even in fright. Startled by the loud\nexplosion, it had jumped four feet into the air before Purnie had\nstopped time. Now it hung there, its beak stuffed with seaweed and its\nthree legs drawn up into a squatting position.\n  \n \n  Leaving the assorted statues behind, he limped his way up the knoll,\ntorn between leaving and staying. What an odd place, this ocean\ncountry! He wondered why he had not heard more detail about the beach\nanimals.\n  \n \n  Reaching the top of the bluff, he looked down upon his silent friends\nwith a feeling of deep sorrow. How he wished he were down there playing\nwith them. But he knew at last that theirs was a game he didn't fit\ninto. Now there was nothing left but to resume time and start the\nlong walk home. Even though the short day was nearly over, he knew he\ndidn't dare use time-stopping to get himself home in nothing flat. His\nfatigued body and clouded mind were strong signals that he had already\nabused this faculty.\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_12]\nAs Purnie lay gathering strength for the long trek home, he saw through\nglazed eyes one of the animals coming back along the beach. When it was\nnearly directly below him, he could hear it making sounds that by now\nhad become familiar.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you?\"\n  \n \n  Purnie paid little attention to the antics of his friend; he was\nbeyond understanding. He wondered what they would say at home when he\nreturned.\n  \n \n  \"We've made a terrible mistake. We—\" The sounds faded in and out on\nPurnie's ears as the creature turned slowly and called in different\ndirections. He watched the animal walk over to the pile of scattered\nlogs and peer around and under them.\n  \n \n  \"If you're hurt I'd like to help!\" The twin moons were high in the sky\nnow, and where their light broke through the swirling clouds a double\nshadow was cast around the animal. With foggy awareness, Purnie watched\nthe creature shake its head slowly, then walk away in the direction of\nthe others.\n  \n \n  Purnie's eyes stared, without seeing, at the panorama before him. The\nbeach was deserted now, and his gaze was transfixed on a shimmering\nwhite square floating on the ocean. Across it, the last thing Purnie\never saw, was emblazoned the word FORBES.\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_9]\nPurnie worked his way down the hill, imploring them to save themselves.\nThe sounds they made carried a new tone, a desperate foreboding of\ndeath.\n  \n \n  \"Rhodes! Cabot! Can you hear me?\"\n  \n \n  \"I—I can't move, Captain. My leg, it's.... My God, we're going to\ndrown!\"\n  \n \n  \"Look around you, Cabot. Can you see anyone moving?\"\n  \n \n  \"The men on the beach are nearly buried, Captain. And the rest of us\nhere in the water—\"\n  \n \n  \"Forbes. Can you see Forbes? Maybe he's—\" His sounds were cut off by a\nwavelet gently rolling over his head.\n  \n \n  Purnie could wait no longer. The tides were all but covering one of the\nanimals, and soon the others would be in the same plight. Disregarding\nthe consequences, he ordered time to stop.\n  \n \n  Wading down into the surf, he worked a log off one victim, then he\ntugged the animal up to the sand. Through blinding tears, Purnie worked\nslowly and carefully. He knew there was no hurry—at least, not as far\nas his friends' safety was concerned. No matter what their condition\nof life or death was at this moment, it would stay the same way until\nhe started time again. He made his way deeper into the orange liquid,\nwhere a raised hand signalled the location of a submerged body. The\nhand was clutching a large white banner that was tangled among the\nlogs. Purnie worked the animal free and pulled it ashore.\n  \n \n  It was the one who had been carrying the shiny object that spit smoke.\n  \n \n  Scarcely noticing his own injured leg, he ferried one victim after\nanother until there were no more in the surf. Up on the beach, he\nstarted unraveling the logs that pinned down the animals caught there.\nHe removed a log from the lap of one, who then remained in a sitting\nposition, his face contorted into a frozen mask of agony and shock.\nAnother, with the weight removed, rolled over like an iron statue into\na new position. Purnie whimpered in black misery as he surveyed the\nchaotic scene before him.\n  \n \n  At last he could do no more; he felt consciousness slipping away from\nhim.\n  \n \n  He instinctively knew that if he lost his senses during a period of\ntime-stopping, events would pick up where they had left off ... without\nhim. For Purnie, this would be death. If he had to lose consciousness,\nhe knew he must first resume time.\n  \n \n  Step by step he plodded up the little hill, pausing every now and then\nto consider if this were the moment to start time before it was too\nlate. With his energy fast draining away, he reached the top of the\nknoll, and he turned to look down once more on the group below.\n  \n \n  Then he knew how much his mind and body had suffered: when he ordered\ntime to resume, nothing happened.\n  \n \n  His heart sank. He wasn't afraid of death, and he knew that if he died\nthe oceans would roll again and his friends would move about. But he\nwanted to see them safe.\n  \n \n  He tried to clear his mind for supreme effort. There was no\n   \n   urging\n   \n  time to start. He knew he couldn't persuade it by bits and pieces,\nfirst slowly then full ahead. Time either progressed or it didn't. He\nhad to take one viewpoint or the other.\n  \n \n  Then, without knowing exactly when it happened, his mind took\ncommand....\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_1]\nBEACH SCENE\n  \n \n  By MARSHALL KING\n  \n \n  Illustrated by WOOD\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Magazine October 1960.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n \n   It was a fine day at the beach\n    \n   for Purnie's game—but his new\n    \n   friends played very rough!\n   \n \n \n \n  Purnie ran laughing and shouting through the forest until he could run\nno more. He fell headlong into a patch of blue moss and whooped with\ndelight in having this day free for exploring. He was free to see the\nocean at last.\n  \n \n  When he had caught his breath, he looked back through the forest. No\nsign of the village; he had left it far behind. Safe from the scrutiny\nof brothers and parents, there was nothing now to stop him from going\nto the ocean. This was the moment to stop time.\n  \n \n  \"On your mark!\" he shouted to the rippling stream and its orange\nwhirlpools. He glanced furtively from side to side, pretending that\nsome object might try to get a head start. \"Get set!\" he challenged\nthe thin-winged bees that hovered over the abundant foliage. \"Stop!\"\nHe shrieked this command upward toward the dense, low-hanging purple\nclouds that perennially raced across the treetops, making one wonder\nhow tall the trees really were.\n  \n \n  His eyes took quick inventory. It was exactly as he knew it would be:\nthe milky-orange stream had become motionless and its minute whirlpools\nhad stopped whirling; a nearby bee hung suspended over a paka plant,\nits transparent wings frozen in position for a downward stroke; and the\nheavy purple fluid overhead held fast in its manufacture of whorls and\nnimbi.\n  \n \n  With everything around him in a state of perfect tableau, Purnie\nhurried toward the ocean.\n  \n \n  If only the days weren't so short! he thought. There was so much to\nsee and so little time. It seemed that everyone except him had seen\nthe wonders of the beach country. The stories he had heard from his\nbrothers and their friends had taunted him for as long as he could\nremember. So many times had he heard these thrilling tales that now,\nas he ran along, he could clearly picture the wonderland as though he\nwere already there. There would be a rockslide of petrified logs to\nplay on, the ocean itself with waves higher than a house, the comical\nthree-legged tripons who never stopped munching on seaweed, and many\nkinds of other wonderful creatures found only at the ocean.\n  \n \n  He bounced through the forest as though the world was reserved this\nday just for him. And who could say it wasn't? he thought. Wasn't this\nhis fifth birthday? He ran along feeling sorry for four-year-olds, and\neven for those who were only four and a half, for they were babies and\nwouldn't dare try slipping away to the ocean alone. But five!\n  \n \n  \"I'll set you free, Mr. Bee—just wait and see!\" As he passed one of\nthe many motionless pollen-gathering insects he met on the way, he took\ncare not to brush against it or disturb its interrupted task.

Through his understanding of the world, we learn that he has never felt real fear before. This makes sense because although he has been warned about stopping time, and he has explicitly been told that it could lead to his death, he decides to go ahead with his birthday plan anyway and stop time and see the ocean. When the humans throw a noose at him in an attempt to capture him, he is shocked to find that his body instinctively runs from it. He doesn’t really experience the fear because he wants to play with them and has no interest in leaving the fun, but his natural impulses as an animal save his life at this moment. Humans have never before visited his planet, so this means that no other animal Purnie has come in contact with has made his body react this way. \nPurnie also demonstrates how evil Forbes is for trying to capture and kill such an innocent and caring animal. When Benson reminds Forbes that it’s illegal to shoot or capture Purnie, Forbes does not care at all. He wants the animal that is emitting radiation because he believes he can make a profit off of him. The value of Purnie’s life means nothing to him. However, as soon as Purnie feels as though his “friends” are in danger, he is willing to risk his own life by stopping time to help them. Purnie feels guilt, regret, and sorrow when he accidentally causes the petrified logs to fall on the men, yet Forbes has none of those feelings when he shoots Purnie in the leg and causes him pain. \n", "Purnie celebrates his fifth birthday by taking his first-ever trip to the beach to take in the sights and meet new friends with the animals his brothers have told him about. Purnie is a small, kangaroo-like creature with the ability to stop time and an extremely upbeat and friendly attitude. Not only does he want to be friends with every animal he encounters, but he also wants to share his lunch with them and show them his ability to do a headstand. Purnie lives in harmony with the forest and its creatures and contrasts with the human explorers who come to lay claim to his planet. Purnie uses his time-stopping ability to extend his birthday because he feels there is not enough time in the day to enjoy all the wonders life has to offer. When he encounters the humans, he is curious because he has never seen their kind before. He listens to the funny sounds they make and follows them persistently, trying to share his lunch with them and demonstrate his headstand. When Forbes orders the men to capture him, Purnie believes they are simply playing a game, and he obliges by evading them. Even after Forbes shoots him, Purnie maintains his positive view of the humans and is more confused by what he did wrong than he is hurt by his actions. This further demonstrates Purnie's naivete and purity of heart. Although his family had warned him about the fatal danger of using his time-stopping powers for too long, Purnie cares more about the survival of the humans he perceives to be his friends and therefore sacrifices his own life to save them when they are crushed by the petrified logs.", "Purnie is a mischievous creature with the ability to stop and restart time who innocently causes a tragedy that he then tries to set right. Purnie is out for a day of exploration for his birthday when he comes across the humans on the beach. The humans have no interest in him until they discover Purnie is radioactive; then Forbes, the man financing the expedition and claiming the planet as his, orders them to put Purnie in one of their lead boxes. He is excited that animals are radioactive because they can reproduce and provide him with an endless supply of radioactive material to make him extremely wealthy. Purnie doesn’t know this, of course, and tries to engage the men in play with him. When he realizes they want him near the box, he teasingly runs close to it then away again. When Forbes shoots Purnie, Purnie sees the noose coming toward his head and instinctively stops times. This allows him to evade capture, make his way atop the bluff, and watch from a safe distance once he restarts time. The men are puzzled at Purnie’s sudden disappearance but plan to catch him when they see him on the bluff. As they approach, Purnie accidentally triggers a rockslide of the petrified logs that spill onto the men, trapping them where they are. Purnie is horrified at what he has caused as he hears the men’s cries of pain. He also notices that the tide is coming in, and the men will drown, so he stops time again, removes the logs from the men, and drags them onto the beach where they will be safe. After everyone is safe, Purnie restarts time, and men are incredulous to find themselves suddenly freed from the logs and on the beach. Forbes goes insane. Before they leave, Benson goes back to look for Purnie and offers to help him if he is wounded.\n", "Purnie creates the juxtaposition of innocent youth against corrupted power in adults. Purnie’s role is of childlike wonder in trying to interact with what it thinks are new friends along the shoreline - while those very friends attempt to capture and kill it. \n\nBecause Purnie is unable to communicate with humans, it also acts as a mime-like guide to the story, providing many physical actions that convey its emotions rather than language. Purnie’s ability to start and stop time creates pause for the reader to exist in the moments of great emotion that Purnie experiences - joy adventuring to the beach, confusion in trying to be captured, horror in thinking it has killed the humans.

That's a lie. I don't believe they were\n   \n   ever\n   \n  plotting\nagainst him. Not even at first. I think they\n   \n   helped\n   \n  him, don't you\nsee?\"\n  \n \n  Ri whined nervously.\n  \n \n  \"It's like this,\" Mia said. \"I see it like this. The Army\n   \n   put\n   \n  him in\npower when the people were in rebellion against military rule.\"\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_5]\nExtrone said, \"To begin with, they probably don't even know I'm here.\nAnd they probably couldn't hit this area if they did know. And you\ncan't afford to let them get a shot at me, anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's why we'd like you to return to an inner planet, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone plucked at his right ear lobe, half closing his eyes. \"You'll\nlose a fleet before you'll dare let anything happen to me, gentlemen.\nI'm quite safe here, I think.\"\n  \n \n  The bearer brought Extrone his drink.\n  \n \n  \"Get off,\" Extrone said quietly to the four officers.\n  \n \n  Again they turned reluctantly. This time, he did not call them back.\nInstead, with amusement, he watched until they disappeared into the\ntangle of forest.\n  \n \n  Dusk was falling. The takeoff blast of the rocket illuminated the area,\ncasting weird shadows on the gently swaying grasses; there was a hot\nbreath of dry air and the rocket dwindled toward the stars.\n  \n \n  Extrone stood up lazily, stretching. He tossed the empty glass away,\nlistened for it to shatter. He reached out, parted the heavy flap to\nhis tent.\n  \n \n  \"Sir?\" Ri said, hurrying toward him in the gathering darkness.\n  \n \n  \"Eh?\" Extrone said, turning, startled. \"Oh, you. Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"We ... located signs of the farn beast, sir. To the east.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone nodded. After a moment he said, \"You killed one, I believe, on\n   \n   your\n   \n  trip?\"\n  \n \n  Ri shifted. \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone held back the flap of the tent. \"Won't you come in?\" he asked\nwithout any politeness whatever.\n  \n \n  Ri obeyed the order.\n  \n \n  The inside of the tent was luxurious. The bed was of bulky feathers,\ncostly of transport space, the sleep curtains of silken gauze. The\nfloor, heavy, portable tile blocks, not the hollow kind, were neatly\nand smoothly inset into the ground. Hanging from the center, to the\nleft of the slender, hand-carved center pole, was a chain of crystals.\nThey tinkled lightly when Extrone dropped the flap. The light was\nelectric from a portable dynamo. Extrone flipped it on. He crossed to\nthe bed, sat down.\n  \n \n  \"You were, I believe, the first ever to kill a farn beast?\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"I.... No, sir. There must have been previous hunters, sir.\"\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_6]\nExtrone narrowed his eyes. \"I see by your eyes that you are\nenvious—that is the word, isn't it?—of my tent.\"\n  \n \n  Ri looked away from his face.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps I'm envious of your reputation as a hunter. You see, I have\nnever killed a farn beast. In fact, I haven't\n   \n   seen\n   \n  a farn beast.\"\n  \n \n  Ri glanced nervously around the tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extrone's\nglittering ones. \"Few people have seen them, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh?\" Extrone questioned mildly. \"I wouldn't say that. I understand\nthat the aliens hunt them quite extensively ... on some of their\nplanets.\"\n  \n \n  \"I meant in our system, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course you did,\" Extrone said, lazily tracing the crease of his\nsleeve with his forefinger. \"I imagine these are the only farn beasts\nin our system.\"\n  \n \n  Ri waited uneasily, not answering.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Extrone said, \"I imagine they are. It would have been a shame if\nyou had killed the last one. Don't you think so?\"\n  \n \n  Ri's hands worried the sides of his outer garment. \"Yes, sir. It would\nhave been.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone pursed his lips. \"It wouldn't have been very considerate of you\nto—But, still, you gained valuable experience. I'm glad you agreed to\ncome along as my guide.\"\n  \n \n  \"It was an honor, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone's lip twisted in wry amusement. \"If I had waited until it was\nsafe for me to hunt on an alien planet, I would not have been able to\nfind such an illustrious guide.\"\n  \n \n  \"... I'm flattered, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Extrone said. \"But you should have spoken to me about it,\nwhen you discovered the farn beast in our own system.\"\n  \n \n  \"I realize that, sir. That is, I had intended at the first opportunity,\nsir....\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Extrone said dryly. \"Like all of my subjects,\" he waved\nhis hand in a broad gesture, \"the highest as well as the lowest slave,\nknow me and love me. I know your intentions were the best.\"\n  \n \n  Ri squirmed, his face pale. \"We do indeed love you, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone bent forward. \"\n   \n   Know\n   \n  me and love me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\n   \n   Know\n   \n  you and love you, sir,\" Ri said.\n  \n \n  \"Get out!\" Extrone said.\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_15]\nThe farn beast coughed. Another answered. They were very near, and\nthere was a noise of crackling underbrush.\n  \n \n  \"He's good bait,\" Extrone said. \"He's fat enough and he knows how to\nscream good.\"\n  \n \n  Ri had stopped screaming; he was huddled against the tree, fearfully\neying the forest across from the watering hole.\n  \n \n  Extrone began to tremble with excitement. \"Here they come!\"\n  \n \n  The forest sprang apart. Extrone bent forward, the gun still across his\nlap.\n  \n \n  The farn beast, its tiny eyes red with hate, stepped out on the bank,\nswinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed.\nIts mate appeared beside it. Their tails thrashed against the scrubs\nbehind them, rattling leaves.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Shoot!\" Lin hissed. \"For God's sake, shoot!\"\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Extrone said. \"Let's see what they do.\" He had not moved\nthe rifle. He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath\nbeginning to sound like an asthmatic pump.\n  \n \n  The lead farn beast sighted Ri. It lowered its head.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Extrone cried excitedly. \"Here it comes!\"\n  \n \n  Ri began to scream again.\n  \n \n  Still Extrone did not lift his blast rifle. He was laughing. Lin\nwaited, frozen, his eyes staring at the farn beast in fascination.\n  \n \n  The farn beast plunged into the water, which was shallow, and, throwing\na sheet of it to either side, headed across toward Ri.\n  \n \n  \"Watch! Watch!\" Extrone cried gleefully.\n  \n \n  And then the aliens sprang their trap.\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_9]\nWith morning came birds' songs, came dew, came breakfast smells.\nThe air was sweet with cooking and it was nostalgic, childhoodlike,\nuncontaminated.\n  \n \n  And Extrone stepped out of the tent, fully dressed, surly, letting the\nflap slap loudly behind him. He stretched hungrily and stared around\nthe camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with sleep.\n  \n \n  \"Breakfast!\" he shouted, and two bearers came running with a folding\ntable and chair. Behind them, a third bearer, carrying a tray of\nvarious foods; and yet behind him, a fourth, with a steaming pitcher\nand a drinking mug.\n  \n \n  Extrone ate hugely, with none of the delicacy sometimes affected in his\nconversational gestures. When he had finished, he washed his mouth with\nwater and spat on the ground.\n  \n \n  \"Lin!\" he said.\n  \n \n  His personal bearer came loping toward him.\n  \n \n  \"Have you read that manual I gave you?\"\n  \n \n  Lin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone pushed the table away. He smacked his lips wetly. \"Very\nludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed that I have two businessmen for\nguides? It occurred to me when I got up. They would have spat on me,\ntwenty years ago, damn them.\"\n  \n \n  Lin waited.\n  \n \n  \"Now I can spit on them, which pleases me.\"\n  \n \n  \"The farn beasts are dangerous, sir,\" Lin said.\n  \n \n  \"Eh? Oh, yes. Those. What did the manual say about them?\"\n  \n \n  \"I believe they're carnivorous, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"An alien manual. That's ludicrous, too. That we have the only\ninformation on our newly discovered fauna from an alien manual—and, of\ncourse, two businessmen.\"\n  \n \n  \"They have very long, sharp fangs, and, when enraged, are capable of\ntearing a man—\"\n  \n \n  \"An alien?\" Extrone corrected.\n  \n \n  \"There's not enough difference between us to matter, sir. Of tearing an\nalien to pieces, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone laughed harshly. \"It's 'sir' whenever you contradict me?\"\n  \n \n  Lin's face remained impassive. \"I guess it seems that way. Sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Damned few people would dare go as far as you do,\" Extrone said. \"But\nyou're afraid of me, too, in your own way, aren't you?\"\n  \n \n  Lin shrugged. \"Maybe.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can see you are. Even my wives are. I wonder if anyone can know how\nwonderful it feels to have people\n   \n   all\n   \n  afraid of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"The farn beasts, according to the manual....\"\n  \n \n  \"You are very insistent on one subject.\"\n  \n \n  \"... It's the only thing I know anything about. The farn beast, as I\nwas saying, sir, is the particular enemy of men. Or if you like, of\naliens. Sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Extrone said, annoyed. \"I'll be careful.\"\n  \n \n  In the distance, a farn beast coughed.\n  \n \n  Instantly alert, Extrone said, \"Get the bearers! Have some of them cut\na path through that damn thicket! And tell those two businessmen to get\nthe hell over here!\"\n  \n \n  Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly afire with the excitement of the hunt.\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_3]\nIt was Mia's turn to shrug. \"Whoever they were, they couldn't have been\nhunters. They'd have kept the secret better.\"\n  \n \n  \"We didn't do so damned well.\"\n  \n \n  \"We didn't have a chance,\" Mia objected. \"Everybody and his brother had\nheard the rumor that farn beasts were somewhere around here. It wasn't\nour fault Extrone found out.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wish we hadn't shot our guide, then. I wish he was here instead of\nus.\"\n  \n \n  Mia shook perspiration out of his eyes. \"We should have shot our pilot,\ntoo. That was our mistake. The pilot must have been the one who told\nExtrone we'd hunted this area.\"\n  \n \n  \"I didn't think a Club pilot would do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"After Extrone said he'd hunt farn beasts, even if it meant going to\nthe alien system? Listen, you don't know.... Wait a minute.\"\n  \n \n  There was perspiration on Ri's upper lip.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  didn't tell Extrone, if that's what you're thinking,\" Mia said.\n  \n \n  Ri's mouth twisted. \"I didn't say you did.\"\n  \n \n  \"Listen,\" Mia said in a hoarse whisper. \"I just thought. Listen. To\nhell with how he found out. Here's the point. Maybe he'll shoot us,\ntoo, when the hunt's over.\"\n  \n \n  Ri licked his lips. \"No. He wouldn't do that. We're not—not just\nanybody. He couldn't kill us like that. Not even\n   \n   him\n   \n  . And besides,\nwhy would he want to do that? It wouldn't do any good to shoot us. Too\nmany people already know about the farn beasts. You said that yourself.\"\n  \n \n  Mia said, \"I hope you're right.\" They stood side by side, studying the\nblast area in silence. Finally, Mia said, \"We better be getting back.\"\n  \n \n  \"What'll we tell him?\"\n  \n \n  \"That we saw tracks. What else can we tell him?\"\n  \n \n  They turned back along their trail, stumbling over vines.\n  \n \n  \"It gets hotter at sunset,\" Ri said nervously.\n  \n \n  \"The breeze dies down.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's screwy. I didn't think farn beasts had this wide a range. There\nmust be a lot of them, to be on both sides of the ridge like this.\"\n  \n \n  \"There may be a pass,\" Mia said, pushing a vine away.\n  \n \n  Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. \"I guess that's it. If there were a lot\nof them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, it's\ndamned funny, when you think about it.\"\n  \n \n  Mia looked up at the darkening sky. \"We better hurry,\" he said.\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_10]\nFour hours later, they were well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked\nleisurely, well back of the cutters, who hacked away, methodically, at\nthe vines and branches which might impede his forward progress. Their\nsharp, awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy\nbreathing.\n  \n \n  Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and drank\ndeeply of the icy water to allay the heat of the forest, a heat made\noppressive by the press of foliage against the outside air.\n  \n \n  Ranging out, on both sides of the central body, the two businessmen\nfought independently against the wild growth, each scouting the flanks\nfor farn beasts, and ahead, beyond the cutters, Lin flittered among the\ntree trunks, sometimes far, sometimes near.\n  \n \n  Extrone carried the only weapon, slung easily over his shoulder, a\npowerful blast rifle, capable of piercing medium armor in sustained\nfire. To his rear, the water carrier was trailed by a man bearing a\nfolding stool, and behind him, a man carrying the heavy, high-powered\ntwo-way communication set.\n  \n \n  Once Extrone unslung his blast rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny,\narboreal mammal, which, upon the impact, shattered asunder, to\nExtrone's satisfied chuckle, in a burst of blood and fur.\n  \n \n  When the sun stood high and heat exhaustion made the near-naked bearers\nslump, Extrone permitted a rest. While waiting for the march to resume,\nhe sat on the stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted,\nreflectively, the blast rifle, lying across his legs.\n  \n \n  \"For you, sir,\" the communications man said, interrupting his reverie.\n  \n \n  \"Damn,\" Extrone muttered. His face twisted in anger. \"It better be\nimportant.\" He took the head-set and mike and nodded to the bearer. The\nbearer twiddled the dials.\n  \n \n  \"Extrone. Eh?... Oh, you got their ship. Well, why in hell bother\nme?... All right, so they found out I was here. You got them, didn't\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"Blasted them right out of space,\" the voice crackled excitedly. \"Right\nin the middle of a radio broadcast, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't want to listen to your gabbling when I'm hunting!\" Extrone\ntore off the head-set and handed it to the bearer. \"If they call back,\nfind out what they want, first. I don't want to be bothered unless it's\nimportant.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone squinted up at the sun; his eyes crinkled under the glare, and\nperspiration stood in little droplets on the back of his hands.\n  \n \n  Lin, returning to the column, threaded his way among reclining\nbearers. He stopped before Extrone and tossed his hair out of his eyes.\n\"I located a spoor,\" he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. \"About\na quarter ahead. It looks fresh.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone's eyes lit with passion.\n  \n \n  Lin's face was red with heat and grimy with sweat. \"There were two, I\nthink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Two?\" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. \"You and I better go forward\nand look at the spoor.\"\n  \n \n  Lin said, \"We ought to take protection, if you're going, too.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone laughed. \"This is enough.\" He gestured with the rifle and stood\nup.\n  \n \n  \"I wish you had let me bring a gun along, sir,\" Lin said.\n  \n \n  \"One is enough in\n   \n   my\n   \n  camp.\"\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_4]\nWhen it came over the hastily established camp, the rocket was low,\nobviously looking for a landing site. It was a military craft, from the\noutpost on the near moon, and forward, near the nose, there was the\nblazoned emblem of the Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over\nExtrone's tent, turned slowly, spouting fuel expensively, and settled\ninto the scrub forest, turning the vegetation beneath it sere by its\nblasts.\n  \n \n  Extrone sat on an upholstered stool before his tent and spat\ndisgustedly and combed his beard with his blunt fingers.\n  \n \n  Shortly, from the direction of the rocket, a group of four high-ranking\nofficers came out of the forest, heading toward him. They were spruce,\nthe officers, with military discipline holding their waists in and\nknees almost stiff.\n  \n \n  \"What in hell do you want?\" Extrone asked.\n  \n \n  They stopped a respectful distance away. \"Sir....\" one began.\n  \n \n  \"Haven't I told you gentlemen that rockets frighten the game?\" Extrone\ndemanded, ominously not raising his voice.\n  \n \n  \"Sir,\" the lead officer said, \"it's another alien ship. It was sighted\na few hours ago, off this very planet, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone's face looked much too innocent. \"How did it get there,\ngentlemen? Why wasn't it destroyed?\"\n  \n \n  \"We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\" Extrone mocked.\n  \n \n  \"We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we could\nlocate and destroy it.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone stared at them for a space. Then, indifferently, he turned\naway, in the direction of a resting bearer. \"You!\" he said. \"Hey! Bring\nme a drink!\" He faced the officers again. He smiled maliciously. \"I'm\nstaying here.\"\n  \n \n  The lead officer licked his firm lower lip. \"But, sir....\"\n  \n \n  Extrone toyed with his beard. \"About a year ago, gentlemen, there was\nan alien ship around here then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it,\ndidn't you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir. When we located it, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll destroy this one, too,\" Extrone said.\n  \n \n  \"We have a tight patrol, sir. It can't slip through. But it might try a\nlong range bombardment, sir.\"\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_1]\nRaiders of the Second Moon\n  \n \n  By GENE ELLERMAN\n  \n \n  A strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_1]\nHUNT the HUNTER\n  \n \n  BY KRIS NEVILLE\n  \n \n  Illustrated by ELIZABETH MacINTYRE\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction June 1951.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Of course using live bait is the best\n   \n  way to lure dangerous alien animals ...\n   \n  unless it turns out that you are the bait!\n  \n \n \n  \"We're somewhat to the south, I think,\" Ri said, bending over the crude\nfield map. \"That ridge,\" he pointed, \"on our left, is right here.\" He\ndrew a finger down the map. \"It was over here,\" he moved the finger,\n\"over the ridge, north of here, that we sighted them.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone asked, \"Is there a pass?\"\n  \n \n  Ri looked up, studying the terrain. He moved his shoulders. \"I don't\nknow, but maybe they range this far. Maybe they're on this side of the\nridge, too.\"\n  \n \n  Delicately, Extrone raised a hand to his beard. \"I'd hate to lose a day\ncrossing the ridge,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Ri said. Suddenly he threw back his head. \"Listen!\"\n  \n \n  \"Eh?\" Extrone said.\n  \n \n  \"Hear it? That cough? I think that's one, from over there. Right up\nahead of us.\"\n  \n \n  Extrone raised his eyebrows.\n  \n \n  This time, the coughing roar was more distant, but distinct.\n  \n \n  \"It is!\" Ri said. \"It's a farn beast, all right!\"\n  \n \n  Extrone smiled, almost pointed teeth showing through the beard. \"I'm\nglad we won't have to cross the ridge.\"\n  \n \n  Ri wiped his forehead on the back of his sleeve. \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll pitch camp right here, then,\" Extrone said. \"We'll go after it\ntomorrow.\" He looked at the sky. \"Have the bearers hurry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  Ri moved away, his pulse gradually slowing. \"You, there!\" he called.\n\"Pitch camp, here!\"\n  \n \n  He crossed to Mia, who, along with him, had been pressed into Extrone's\nparty as guides. Once more, Ri addressed the bearers, \"Be quick, now!\"\nAnd to Mia, \"God almighty, he was getting mad.\" He ran a hand under his\ncollar. \"It's a good thing that farn beast sounded off when it did. I'd\nhate to think of making him climb that ridge.\"\n  \n \n  Mia glanced nervously over his shoulder. \"It's that damned pilot's\nfault for setting us down on this side. I told him it was the other\nside. I told him so.\"\n  \n \n  Ri shrugged hopelessly.\n  \n \n  Mia said, \"I don't think he even saw a blast area over here. I think he\nwanted to get us in trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"There shouldn't be one. There shouldn't be a blast area on this side\nof the ridge, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's what I mean.

It's not only the killing\nthat matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's not\n   \n   only\n   \n  the killing,\" Lin echoed.\n  \n \n  \"You understand?\" Extrone said. \"How it is to wait, knowing in just a\nminute something is going to come out of the forest, and you're going\nto kill it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" Lin said.\n  \n \n  \"But it's not only the killing. It's the waiting, too.\"\n  \n \n  The farn beast coughed again; nearer.\n  \n \n  \"It's a different one,\" Lin said.\n  \n \n  \"How do you know?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hear the lower pitch, the more of a roar?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" Extrone shouted. \"You, down there. There are two coming. Now\nlet's hear you really scream!\"\n  \n \n  Ri, below, whimpered childishly and began to retreat toward the tether\ntree, his eyes wide.\n  \n \n  \"There's a lot of satisfaction in fooling them, too,\" Extrone said.\n\"Making them come to your bait, where you can get at them.\" He\nopened his right hand. \"Choose your ground, set your trap. Bait it.\"\nHe snapped his hand into a fist, held the fist up before his eyes,\nimprisoning the idea. \"Spring the trap when the quarry is inside.\nClever. That makes the waiting more interesting. Waiting to see if they\nreally will come to your bait.\"\n  \n \n  Lin shifted, staring toward the forest.\n  \n \n  \"I've always liked to hunt,\" Extrone said. \"More than anything else, I\nthink.\"\n  \n \n  Lin spat toward the ground. \"People should hunt because they have to.\nFor food. For safety.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Extrone argued. \"People should hunt for the love of hunting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Killing?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hunting,\" Extrone repeated harshly.\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_2]\nMia looked at his companion. He spat. \"What hurts most, he pays us for\nit. I could buy half this planet, and he makes me his guide—at less\nthan I pay my secretary.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, anyway, we won't have to cross that ridge.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you!\" Extrone called.\n  \n \n  The two of them turned immediately.\n  \n \n  \"You two scout ahead,\" Extrone said. \"See if you can pick up some\ntracks.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" Ri said, and instantly the two of them readjusted their\nshoulder straps and started off.\n  \n \n  Shortly they were inside of the scrub forest, safe from sight. \"Let's\nwait here,\" Mia said.\n  \n \n  \"No, we better go on. He may have sent a spy in.\"\n  \n \n  They pushed on, being careful to blaze the trees, because they were not\nprofessional guides.\n  \n \n  \"We don't want to get too near,\" Ri said after toiling through the\nforest for many minutes. \"Without guns, we don't want to get near\nenough for the farn beast to charge us.\"\n  \n \n  They stopped. The forest was dense, the vines clinging.\n  \n \n  \"He'll want the bearers to hack a path for him,\" Mia said. \"But we go\nit alone. Damn him.\"\n  \n \n  Ri twisted his mouth into a sour frown. He wiped at his forehead. \"Hot.\nBy God, it's hot. I didn't think it was this hot, the first time we\nwere here.\"\n  \n \n  Mia said, \"The first time,\n   \n   we\n   \n  weren't guides. We didn't notice it so\nmuch then.\"\n  \n \n  They fought a few yards more into the forest.\n  \n \n  Then it ended. Or, rather, there was a wide gap. Before them lay a\nblast area, unmistakable. The grass was beginning to grow again, but\nthe tree stumps were roasted from the rocket breath.\n  \n \n  \"This isn't ours!\" Ri said. \"This looks like it was made nearly a year\nago!\"\n  \n \n  Mia's eyes narrowed. \"The military from Xnile?\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Ri said. \"They don't have any rockets this small. And I don't\nthink there's another cargo rocket on this planet outside of the one we\nleased from the Club. Except the one\n   \n   he\n   \n  brought.\"\n  \n \n  \"The ones who discovered the farn beasts in the first place?\" Mia\nasked. \"You think it's their blast?\"\n  \n \n  \"So?\" Ri said. \"But who are they?\"\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_13]\nThey were at the watering hole—Extrone, Lin, two bearers, and Ri.\n  \n \n  Since the hole was drying, the left, partially exposed bank was steep\ntoward the muddy water. Upon it was green, new grass, tender-tuffed,\nhalf mashed in places by heavy animal treads. It was there that they\nstaked him out, tying the free end of the rope tightly around the base\nof a scaling tree.\n  \n \n  \"You will scream,\" Extrone instructed. With his rifle, he pointed\nacross the water hole. \"The farn beast will come from this direction, I\nimagine.\"\n  \n \n  Ri was almost slobbering in fear.\n  \n \n  \"Let me hear you scream,\" Extrone said.\n  \n \n  Ri moaned weakly.\n  \n \n  \"You'll have to do better than that.\" Extrone inclined his head toward\na bearer, who used something Ri couldn't see.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ri screamed.\n  \n \n  \"See that you keep it up that way,\" Extrone said. \"That's the way I\nwant you to sound.\" He turned toward Lin. \"We can climb this tree, I\nthink.\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, aided by the bearers, the two men climbed the tree, bark\npeeling away from under their rough boots. Ri watched them hopelessly.\n  \n \n  Once at the crotch, Extrone settled down, holding the rifle at alert.\nLin moved to the left, out on the main branch, rested in a smaller\ncrotch.\n  \n \n  Looking down, Extrone said, \"Scream!\" Then, to Lin, \"You feel the\nexcitement? It's always in the air like this at a hunt.\"\n  \n \n  \"I feel it,\" Lin said.\n  \n \n  Extrone chuckled. \"You were with me on Meizque?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"That was something, that time.\" He ran his hand along the stock of the\nweapon.\n  \n \n  The sun headed west, veiling itself with trees; a large insect circled\nExtrone's head. He slapped at it, angry. The forest was quiet,\nunderlined by an occasional piping call, something like a whistle. Ri's\nscreams were shrill, echoing away, shiveringly. Lin sat quiet, hunched.\n  \n \n  Extrone's eyes narrowed, and he began to pet the gun stock with quick,\njerky movements. Lin licked his lips, keeping his eyes on Extrone's\nface. The sun seemed stuck in the sky, and the heat squeezed against\nthem, sucking at their breath like a vacuum. The insect went away.\nStill, endless, hopeless, monotonous, Ri screamed.\n\n[Chapter: HUNT_the_HUNTER_8]\nRi swallowed. \"We couldn't make the people believe that.\"\n  \n \n  \"No?\" Mia challenged. \"Couldn't we? Not today, but what about tomorrow?\nYou'll see. Because I think the Army is getting ready to invade the\nalien system!\"\n  \n \n  \"The people won't support them,\" Ri answered woodenly.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Think.\n   \n  If he tells them to, they will.

He has hired guides, Ri and Mia, who are businessmen who have successfully shot a farn beast on a prior private trip. They attempted to conceal their killing of a farn beast on that trip, however, the word got out and now Extrone has forced them (seemingly against their will) to be the guides for his own trip. Ri and Mia do not turn out to be very good guides. Mia is unsupportive of Extrone and suspicious of his activities and potential plans to violently attack the aliens, and Ri is fearful of that talk and of Extrone himself causing him to be unhelpful as a guide.\n\nExtrone refers to being loved by his “subjects” suggesting he has a position of royalty or power. The military is at his disposal and seem eager to please him. He is highly focused on finding and killing a farn beast any way possible - and attempts sacrificing his guide Ri as bait for the animal to do it. He kills Mia by shooting him in the back after Ri accuses him of intent to kill Extrone, suggesting Extrone is a violent ruler.\n\nExtrone’s focus is on killing a farn beast and this blinds him to the existence of an alien trap on the planet. It is heavily implied that the aliens have intentions to do harm to Extrone, and it is revealed that his fixation on the farn beast led him directly into a trap set by the aliens to capture him.\n", "Extrone, a prominent leader of the humans, has taken his hunting party to track down a farn beast, a newly-discovered creature. His guides are two businessman, Ri and Mia, who were the first to come across and kill a farn beast. They are there begrdugingly, but their fear of Extrone is clear. They arrive on the wrong side of the ridge and are searching for a way to cross it to reach the farn beasts. Ri hears the cough of a farn beast on their side, and Extrone is pleased they won’t have to waste time crossing the ridge. They set up camp there, and Extrone asks Mia and Ri to scout ahead and find farn beast tracks. No one is armed, except for Extrone, so Mia and Ri are extremely cautious not to get too far into the beasts’ territory. They’re sweating as they come across land marred by a rocket’s blast off probably from a year ago. They theorize that it’s the people who discovered the beasts, though they don’t know who. \nRi reveals that they shot their guide after finding the farn beast, but not their pilot. They bicker a little, scared of Extrone and the possibility of him killing them afterward. They agree to hide the blast area from him, but inform him they found tracks instead. A rocket flies over the camp, looking for Extrone. They land near and tell Extrone that an alien ship was spotted on this planet. They were unable to destroy it at the time. Extrone gives out orders to destroy it and then sends them away. Extrone asserts his dominance over Ri after they return. Ri and Mia rest in their sleeping bags, discussing what they need to do about Extrone. \nThe next morning, Extrone’s personal bearer, Lin, presents alien information about the farn beasts. They begin their trek into the forest, people cutting the way for Extrone who managed to kill one small animal with his weapon. Extrone’s men were able to shoot down the alien ship. Lin finds a spoor and leads Extrone to it, revealing on the way that the farn beasts are great hunters. Extrone decides to use Ri as bait to draw the beasts to him. \nWhen he informs Ri of his decision, Ri betrays Mia in a way to guarantee his safety. So, Extrone kills Mia and then uses Ri as bait anyway. After stringing him up and torturing him, his screams eventually draw the farn beast near. A farn beast and its mate appear and charge Ri. The story ends with Extrone holding fire as the farn beast nears, and the alien trap being sprung. \n", "General Extrone is on a hunting trip to kill a farn. To help him track the farn, he has hired two businessmen, Ri and Mia, who actually killed the first farn, which Extrone resents; he wanted to kill the first one. While Ri and Mia are out tracking the farn beast, they talk about how much they hate working for Extrone since he is a self-centered, egotist who cares nothing about anyone except himself. After Ri and Mia killed their farn, they killed their guide to keep word from getting out about it. Now they wonder if their pilot was the one who told others about it. Mia points out to Ri that Extrone might just shoot them after the hunt is over, but Ri says Extrone wouldn’t do that because they aren’t a couple of nobodies. Meanwhile, a low-flying rocket passes overhead and lands; it is part of Extrone’s Ninth Fleet with news that an alien ship has been sighted near the planet where the general is hunting. Extrone refuses to leave with them for someplace safer, instead making it clear he expects them to take care of the problem. Ri and Mia return to camp, and Extrone has Ri give him an update. Extrone makes it clear that the two businessmen had better not have killed the last farn beast and then make Ri say he knows and loves Extrone. Later than night, Mia tells Ri he is afraid Extrone will kill them before he lets them return to civilization. Mia points out lies that Extrone has told, such as that the army tried to plot against him; Mia figured out that the army was helping him. He also thinks Extrone cut off trade with the aliens because he is getting ready to invade them. The next day, Extrone talks with his personal bearer, Lin, who has read an alien manual about the farn beast. When Extrone complains about Ri and Mia, Lin keeps telling him facts about the farn beast. Extrone allows Lin to disagree with him, but Lin always follows his statement with “Sir.” Hunting later that day, Lin spies a spoor and shows it to Extrone. When they hear the farn cough, Lin says it’s a good thing they are downwind; otherwise the farn beast would track them down. This gives Extrone the idea of using a human for bait and chooses Ri. When Ri realizes what is planned, he tells Extrone that Mia has been talking about killing Extrone. Extrone shoots Mia and still uses Ri for bait, which does lure two farn beasts. Instead of killing them, Extrone waits to see what they will do. The the aliens spring their trap.\n", "Ri and Mia are two businessmen hired as guides by Extrone, a violent, though popular leader, on his mission to hunt farn beasts. They were hired because of their success killing a farn beast during one of their Hunting Club missions. Soon after their arrival on the planet where the hunt takes place, Ri hears a farn beast cough while plotting their course with Extrone, and Extrone sends him and Mia into the forest to track it. Ri and Mia bemoan the fact that they have been hired for this purpose in spite of the fact that neither of them is a professional guide; they merely have hunted a farn beast in the past. As they track the beast, they discover a blast area and cannot identify the source of it, although they do know it wasn't created by one of the Hunting Club's rockets. When they make their way back to camp, they worry about if Extrone will kill them after the hunt in order to keep the discovery of the farn beasts a secret despite the fact that rumors of their existence had already spread. Extrone has killed others in the past. Back at camp, a group of high-ranking officers from the Ninth Fleet visit Extrone to warn him about the presence of a nearby alien spacecraft, fearing it is seeking him out to exterminate him. Extrone orders them to destroy it and scoffs at the idea that he might not be safe on this planet. After the officers leave, Extrone calls Ri into his tent and admits he needs him because he has never seen a farn beast and would have hunted them on alien planets (where he has heard they hunt them frequently) had it been safe for him to do so. It is clear from his conversation with Ri that Extrone is loved by his constituents and hated by his alien enemies. When Ri joins Mia later, they again discuss their fear of being killed after the hunt, and Mia suggests the army purposefully installed Extrone as puppet leader during the anti-military rebellion in order to gain popular support for their eventual attack on the alien system. Ri refuses to believe Mia's theories whether out of fear or denial; either way, Ri and Mia guides Extrone's hunt the next morning, joined by Extrone's personal bearer Lin and several other attendants. Lin warns a dismissive Extrone of the dangers of the farn beasts, and Extrone decides to use Ri as bait to lure them to their spot. In a panic, Ri tells Extrone to use Mia instead, since he had plotted to kill Extrone. Without missing a beat, Extrone kills Mia and continues to use Ri as bait. Lin and Extrone hideaway as Ri screams and draws the farn beasts to their location. Suddenly, the aliens the Ninth Fleet officers had warned Extrone about spring their trap. They had been using Extrone as bait to catch the farn beasts themselves."]}}

Horst, look who we have here,\" he called. It was the one\nwho'd made the joke about me being beneath the notice of a Losel. He\nwas alone with me now, but with that call the others would be up fast.\n  \n \n  I brought the saddle around as hard as I could and then up, and he\nwent down. He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on him\nand reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then from\nbehind and pinned my arms to my side.\n  \n \n  I opened my mouth to scream—I have a good scream—but a rough smelly\nhand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than a\nlungful of air. I bit down hard—5000 lbs. psi, I'm told—but he\ndidn't let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feet\nand dragged me off.\n  \n \n  When we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stopped\ndragging me and dropped me in a heap. \"Make any noise,\" he said, \"and\nI'll hurt you.\"\n  \n \n  That was a silly way to put it, but somehow it said more than if he'd\nthreatened to break my arm or my head. It left him a latitude of things\nto do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlight\nfor that. \"I ought to club you anyway,\" he said.\n  \n \n  The one I'd dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were putting\nthe animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" he said. \"Look through the kid's gear, bring the horse and what\nwe can use.\"\n  \n \n  The other one didn't move. \"Get going, Jack,\" Horst said in a menacing\ntone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finally\nbacked down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn't so much objecting to me\nbeing kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in his\nbunch.\n  \n \n  But I wasn't done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol under\nmy jacket.\n  \n \n  Horst turned back to me and I said, \"You can't do this and get away\nwith it.\"\n  \n \n  He said, \"Look, boy. You may not know it, but you be in a lot of\ntrouble. So don't give me a hard time.\"\n  \n \n  He still thought I was a boy. It was not time to correct him, but I\ndidn't like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering.\n  \n \n  \"The courts won't let you get away with this,\" I said. I'd passed\na courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUAL\nJUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or\nsomething stuffy like that.\n  \n \n  He laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so I\nknew I'd goofed.\n  \n \n  \"Boy, boy.

I slipped my hand under my\njacket.\n  \n \n  \"Every time you open your mouth you shout that you be off one of the\nShips,\" Horst said. \"That be enough.

I said, \"Hand\nthat over to me.\"\n  \n \n  Horst made a disgusted sound.\n  \n \n  \"Don't make any noise,\" I said, \"or you'll fry. Now hand it over.\"\n  \n \n  I stowed it away, then paused with one hand on the leather horn of the\nsaddle. \"What's the name of the kid in jail in Forton.\"\n  \n \n  \"I can't remember,\" he said. \"But it be coming to me. Hold on.\"\n  \n \n  I waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behind\nand the gun went flying.

He dropped it on the ground and\nsaid in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it was\nnatural and mine wasn't, \"The piece be yours.\" Then he tromped on it\nuntil it cracked and fell apart.\n  \n \n  Then he said, \"Pull a gun on me twice. Twice.\" He slapped me so hard\nthat my ears rang. \"You dirty little punk.\"\n  \n \n  I said calmly, \"You big louse.\"\n  \n \n  It was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut. All I can\nremember is a flash of pain as his fist crunched against the side of my\nface and then nothing.\n  \n \n  Brains are no good if you don't use them.\n\n[Chapter: DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_4]\nThe first thing you learn in school is that if it weren't for idiot and\ncriminal people like these, Earth would never have been destroyed. The\nevacuation would never have had to take place, and eight billion people\nwouldn't have died. There wouldn't have\n   \n   been\n   \n  eight billion people.\nBut, no. They bred and they spread and they devoured everything in\ntheir path like a cancer. They gobbled up all the resources that Earth\nhad and crowded and shoved one another until the final war came.\n  \n \n  I am lucky. My great-great-grandparents were among those who had enough\nforesight to see what was coming. If it hadn't been for them and some\nothers like them, there wouldn't be any humans left anywhere. And I\nwouldn't be here. That may not scare you, but it scares me.\n  \n \n  What happened before, when people didn't use their heads and wound up\nblowing the Solar System apart, is something nobody should forget. The\nolder people don't let us forget. But these people had, and that the\nCouncil should know.\n  \n \n  For the first time since I landed on Tintera, I felt\n   \n   really\n   \n  frightened. There was too much going on that I didn't understand. I\nfelt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I\nwhomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head.\n  \n \n  I let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk\nagain. I couldn't help wishing for Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he's\nsmart and brains I needed.\n  \n \n  How do you find out what's going on? Eavesdrop? That's a lousy method.\nFor one thing, people can't be depended on to talk about the things you\nwant to hear. For another, you're likely to get caught. Ask somebody?\nWho? Make the mistake of bracing a fellow like Horst and you might wind\nup with a sore head and an empty pocket. The best thing I could think\nof was to find a library, but that might be a job.\n  \n \n  I'd had two bad shocks on this day, but they weren't the last. In the\nlate afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink and a cool wind was\nstarting to ripple the tree leaves, I saw the scoutship high in the\nsky. The dying sun colored it a deep red. Back again? I wondered what\nhad gone wrong.\n  \n \n  I reached down into my saddlebag and brought out my contact signal.\nThe scoutship swung up in the sky in a familiar movement calculated to\ndrop the stomach out of everybody aboard. George Fuhonin's style. I\ntriggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn't\nknow why he was back, but I wasn't really sorry.\n  \n \n  The ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my\nhead, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started\nbucking so hard that I knew this wasn't hot piloting at all, just plain\nidiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me\noverhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn't one of ours.\nNot too different, but not ours.\n  \n \n \n \n  One more enigma. Where was it from? Not here. Even if you know how, and\nwe wouldn't tell these Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is something that\ntakes an advanced technology to build.\n\n[Chapter: DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_5]\nI felt defeated and tired. Not much farther along the road, I came to\na campsite with two wagons pulled in for the night, and I couldn't\nhelp but pull in myself. The campsite was large and had two permanent\nbuildings on it. One was a well enclosure and the other was little more\nthan a high-walled pen. It didn't even have a roof.\n  \n \n  I set up camp and ate my dinner. In the wagon closest to me were a man,\nhis wife and their three children. The kids were running around and\nplaying, and one of them ran close to the high-walled pen. His father\ncame and pulled him away.\n  \n \n  The kids weren't to blame for their parents, but when one of them said\nhello to me, I didn't even answer. I know how lousy I would feel if I\nhad two or three brothers and sisters, but it didn't strike me until\nthat moment that it wouldn't even seem out of the ordinary to these\nkids. Isn't that horrible?\n  \n \n  About the time I finished eating, and before it grew dark, the old man\nI had seen earlier in the day drove his wagon in. He fascinated me. He\nhad white hair, something I had read about in stories but had never\nseen before.\n  \n \n  When nightfall came, they started a large fire. Everybody gathered\naround. There was singing for awhile, and then the father of the\nchildren tried to pack them off to bed. But they weren't ready to go,\nso the old man started telling them a story. In the old man's odd\naccent, and sitting there in the campfire light surrounded by darkness,\nit seemed just right.\n  \n \n  It was about an old witch named Baba Yaga who lived in the forest in\na house that stood on chicken legs. She was the nasty stepmother of a\nnice little girl, and to get rid of the kid, she sent her on a phony\nerrand into the deep dark woods at nightfall. I could appreciate the\npoor girl's position. All the little girl had to help her were the\nhandkerchief, the comb and the pearl that she had inherited from her\ndear dead mother. But, as it turned out, they were just enough to\ndefeat nasty old Baba Yaga and bring the girl safely home.\n  \n \n  I wished for the same for myself.\n  \n \n  The old man had just finished and they were starting to drag the kids\noff to bed when there was a commotion on the road at the edge of the\ncamp. I looked but my eyes were adjusted to the light of the fire and I\ncouldn't see far into the dark.\n  \n \n  A voice there said, \"I'll be damned if I'll take another day like this\none, Horst. We should have been here hours ago. It be your fault we're\nnot.\"\n  \n \n  Horst growled a retort. I decided that it was time for me to leave the\ncampfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the\nfire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets\nand mattress and started to roll them up. I had a pretty good idea now\nwhat they used the high-walled pen for.\n  \n \n  I should have known that they would have to pen the animals up for the\nnight. I should have used my head. I hadn't and now it was time to take\nleave.\n  \n \n  I never got the chance.\n\n[Chapter: DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_3]\nWe'd come in from the west over the ocean, so I traveled east on the\nroad. That much water makes me nervous, and roads have to go somewhere.\n  \n \n  I came on my first travelers three hours later. I rounded a tree-lined\nbend, ducking an overhanging branch, and pulled Ninc to a stop. There\nwere five men on horseback herding a bunch of the ugliest creatures\nalive.\n  \n \n  They were green and grotesque. They had squat bodies, long limbs and\nknobby bulges at their joints. They had square, flat animal masks for\nfaces. But they walked on their hind legs and they had paws that were\nalmost hands, and that was enough to make them seem almost human. They\nmade a wordless, chilling, lowing sound as they milled and plodded\nalong.\n  \n \n  I started Ninc up again and moved slowly to catch up with them. All the\nmen on horseback had guns in saddle boots. They looked as nervous as\ncats with kittens. One of them had a string of packhorses on a line\nand he saw me and called to another who seemed to be the leader. That\none wheeled his black horse and rode back toward me.\n  \n \n  He was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as my Daddy. He was large and he\nhad a hard face. Normal enough, but hard. He pulled to a halt when we\nreached each other, but I kept going. He had to come around and follow\nme. I believe in judging a person by his face. A man can't help the\nface he owns, but he can help the expression he wears on it. If a man\nlooks mean, I generally believe that he is. This one looked mean. That\nwas why I kept riding.\n  \n \n  He said, \"What be you doing out here, boy? Be you out of your head?\nThere be escaped Losels in these woods.\"\n  \n \n  I told you I hadn't finished filling out yet, but I hadn't thought it\nwas that bad. I wasn't ready to make a fight over the point, though.\nGenerally, I can't keep my bloody mouth shut, but now I didn't say\nanything. It seemed smart.\n  \n \n  \"Where be you from?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  I pointed to the road behind us.\n  \n \n  \"And where be you going?\"\n  \n \n  I pointed ahead. No other way to go.\n  \n \n  He seemed exasperated. I have that effect sometimes. Even on Mother and\nDaddy, who should know better.\n  \n \n  We were coming up on the others now, and the man said, \"Maybe you'd\nbetter ride on from here with us. For protection.\"\n  \n \n  He had an odd way of twisting his sounds, almost as though he had a\nmouthful of mush. I wondered whether he were just an oddball or whether\neverybody here spoke the same way. I'd never heard International\nEnglish spoken any way but one, even on the planet Daddy made me visit\nwith him.\n  \n \n  One of the other outriders came easing by then. I suppose they'd been\nwatching us all the while. He called to the hard man.\n  \n \n  \"He be awfully small, Horst. I doubt me a Losel'd even notice him at\nall. We mought as well throw him back again.\"\n  \n \n  The rider looked at me. When I didn't dissolve in terror as he\nexpected, he shrugged and one of the other men laughed.\n  \n \n  The hard man said to the others, \"This boy will be riding along with us\nto Forton for protection.\"\n  \n \n  I looked down at the plodding, unhappy creatures they were driving\nalong and one looked back at me with dull, expressionless golden eyes.\nI felt uncomfortable.\n  \n \n  I said, \"I don't think so.\"\n  \n \n  What the man did then surprised me. He said, \"I do think so,\" and\nreached for the rifle in his saddle boot.\n  \n \n  I whipped my sonic pistol out so fast that he was caught leaning over\nwith the rifle half out. His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he\ndidn't want to be fried.\n  \n \n  I said, \"Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.\"\n  \n \n  They did, watching me all the while with wary expressions.\n  \n \n  When all the rifles were on the ground, I said, \"All right, let's go.\"\n  \n \n  They didn't want to move. They didn't want to leave the rifles. I\ncould see that. Horst didn't say anything. He just watched me with\nnarrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling\ntones said, \"Look here, kid....\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up,\" I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did. It\nsurprised me. I didn't think I sounded\n   \n   that\n   \n  mean. I decided he just\ndidn't trust the crazy kid not to shoot.\n  \n \n  After twenty minutes of easy riding for us and hard walking for the\ncreatures, I said, \"If you want your rifles, you can go back and get\nthem now.\" I dug my heels into Ninc's sides and rode on. At the next\nbend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and\nthe creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road.\n  \n \n  I put this episode in the \"file and hold for analysis\" section in my\nmind and rode on, feeling good. I think I even giggled once. Sometimes\nI even convince myself that I'm hell on wheels.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  When I was nine, my Daddy gave me a painted wooden doll that my\ngreat-grandmother brought from Earth. The thing is that inside it,\nnestled one in another, are eleven more dolls, each one smaller than\nthe last. I like to watch people when they open it for the first time.\n  \n \n  My face must have been like that as I rode along the road.\n  \n \n  The country leveled into a great rolling valley and the trees gave\nway to great farms and fields. In the fields, working, were some of\nthe green creatures, which surprised me since the ones I'd seen before\nhadn't seemed smart enough to count to one, let alone do any work.\n  \n \n  But it relieved me. I thought they might have been eating them or\nsomething.\n  \n \n  I passed two crossroads and started to meet more people, but nobody\nquestioned me. I met people on horseback, and twice I met trucks moving\nsilently past. And I overtook a wagon driven by the oldest man I've\nseen in my life. He waved to me, and I waved back.\n  \n \n  Near the end of the afternoon I came to the town, and there I received\na jolt that sickened me.\n  \n \n  By the time I came out on the other side, I was sick. My hands were\ncold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to\na gallop.\n  \n \n  I rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all\nstone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were\nno machines more complicated than the trucks I'd seen earlier. At the\nedge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the\nwindow—INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it.\n  \n \n  But I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn't\nsee one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There\nwere little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All\nthe boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why\nHorst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn't flattering; but\nI decided I'd not tell anybody different until I found what made the\nclocks tick on this planet.\n  \n \n  But that wasn't what bothered me. It was the kids. My God! They\nswarmed. I saw a family come out of a house—a father and\n   \n   four\n   \n  children. It was the most foul thing I've ever seen. It struck me\nthen—these people were Free Birthers! I felt a wave of nausea and I\nclosed my eyes until it passed.\n\n[Chapter: DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_1]\nDOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN\n  \n \n  BY ALEXEI PANSHIN\n  \n \n  The ancient rule was sink or swim—swim\n   \n  in the miasma of a planet without\n   \n  spaceflight, or sink to utter destruction!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  The horses and packs were loaded before we went aboard the scoutship.\nThe scout bay is no more than a great oversized airlock with a dozen\nsmall ships squatting over their tubes, but it was the last of the Ship\nthat I might ever see, so I took a long final look from the top of the\nramp.\n  \n \n  There were sixteen of us girls and thirteen boys. We took our places\nin the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke that\nnobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feeling\nlost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over to\nme. He's red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. An\nintelligent runt like me.\n  \n \n  He said what I expected. \"Mia, do you want to go partners if we can get\ntogether when we get down?\"\n  \n \n  I guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I liked\nhim. Well, I did when I wasn't mad at him, but now I had that crack\nhe'd made about being a snob in mind, so I said, \"Not likely. I want to\ncome back alive.\" It wasn't fair, but it was a good crack and he went\nback to his place without saying anything.\n  \n \n  My name is Mia Havero. I'm fourteen, of course, or I wouldn't be\ntelling this. I'm short, dark and scrawny, though I don't expect that\nscrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In the\nmeantime, I've got brains as a consolation.\n  \n \n  After we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps.\nWe sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube and\nthen we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn't have to\nleave that way, but George thinks it's fun to be a hot pilot.\n  \n \n  Thinking it over, I was almost sorry I'd been stinking to Jimmy D. He's\nthe only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don't go\npartners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still that\ncrack about being a snob.\n  \n \n  The planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contact\nthe Ship had had with it—and we were the ones who dropped them—was\nalmost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Council\ndebate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it was\nall right in the end. It didn't make any practical difference to us\nkids because they never tell you anything about the place they're going\nto drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn't have known that much\nif Daddy weren't Chairman of the Council.\n  \n \n  I felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobody\nelse was breaking down, so I didn't. I did feel miserable. I cried when\nI said good-by to Mother and Daddy—a real emotional scene—but that\nwasn't in public.\n\n[Chapter: DOWN_TO_THE_WORLDS_OF_MEN_2]\nIt wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really,\nbecause I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me\nunhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month.\nPlanets make me feel wretched.\n  \n \n  The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and\ncalves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on\na piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere\nand little grubby things just looking for\n   \n   you\n   \n  to crawl on. If you\ncan think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty\nimagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells—I've\nbeen on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but\nnot for me.\n  \n \n  We have a place in the Ship like that—the Third Level—but it's only a\nthousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up\na level or down a level and be back in civilization.\n  \n \n  When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the\nsea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested\nhills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They\ndon't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his\ngear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still\nsmarting from the slap I'd given him.\n  \n \n  In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see\nJimmy—if he would get back alive.\n  \n \n  It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the\nnearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound\nlike fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.\n  \n \n  Don't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow\nfor fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They\ndo figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time\nyou're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to\nthe Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship\nis a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that\nsomething has to be done in a closed society to keep the population\nfrom decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to\nkeep the population steady.\n  \n \n  I began to check my gear out—sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be\nfound at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes.\nVenie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start\ngetting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next\nlanding, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn't\nhave anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the\nbad moment any longer.\n  \n \n  The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird,\nand in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the\ncolor of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the\nlights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in\nthe dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach\nif it's really going to come back. But I lived through it—one day in\nthirty gone.\n  \n \n  I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three\nthings in mind—stay alive, find people and find some of the others.\nThe first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot\nI could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to\ncamp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces,\nthough not with that meatball Jimmy D.\n  \n \n  No, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take\nnothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from\nnobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.\n  \n \n  I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November—too close to\nYear End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was\nspring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got\nback we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to\nlook forward to.\n  \n \n  In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking\nanimals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty\ngood, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the\nbest meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I\nwondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and\nthey've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good\nthat I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.\n  \n \n  On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the\nhillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching\nit in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a\nhard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks\nof horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't\nidentify.\n  \n \n  One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when\nthey dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the\nactual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on\nEarth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were\nestablished, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have\ndraft animals.\n  \n \n  The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight,\nas well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything\nelse in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies\nwere planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that\n   \n   could\n   \n  have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have\nhad to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll\nbet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses.\n\n[Chapter: I,_the_Unspeakable_10]\nShe started to laugh, and then, as she emerged from the passageway into\nthe big circular room, she cut her laugh short.\n  \n \n  A second later, as I came along, I saw why.\n  \n \n  There were two Deacons by the central desk. They were burly and had\nthat hard, pinched-face look and wore the usual black belts. Electric\nclubs hung from the belts. Spidery looking pistols were at their sides.\n  \n \n  I didn't know whether these two had heard my crack or not. I know they\nkept looking at me.\n  \n \n  Lara and I crossed the room silently, she back to her desk, I to the\nexit door. The Deacons' remote, disapproving eyes swung in azimuth,\ntracking us.\n  \n \n  I walked out and wanted to turn and smile at Lara, and get into my\nsmile something of the hope that someday, somewhere, I'd see her\nagain—but of course I didn't dare.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  I had the usual difficulties at Travbur the next day. I won't go into\nthem, except to say that I was batted from office to office like a ping\npong ball, and that, when I finally got my travel permit, I was made to\nfeel that I had stolen an original Picasso from the State Museum.\n  \n \n  I made it in a day. Just. I got my permit thirty seconds before closing\ntime. I was to take the jetcopter to Center One at 0700 hours the\nfollowing morning.\n  \n \n  In my living machine that evening, I was much too excited to work at\ntheoretical research as I usually did after a hard day of tramping\naround. I bathed, I paced a while, I sat and hummed nervously and\ngot up and paced again. I turned on the telepuppets. There was a\ndrama about the space pilots who fly the nonconformist prisoners to\nthe forests and pulp-acetate plants on Mars. Seemed that the Southem\npolitical prisoners who are confined to the southern hemisphere of\nMars, wanted to attack and conquer the north. The nonconformists, led\nby our pilot, came through for the State in the end. Corn is thicker\nthan water. Standard.\n  \n \n  There were, however, some good stereofilm shots of the limitless\nforests of Mars, and I wondered what it would be like to live there, in\na green, fresh-smelling land. Pleasant, I supposed, if you could put up\nwith the no doubt revolting morality of a prison planet.\n  \n \n  And the drama seemed to point out that there was no more security for\nthe nonconformists out there than for us here on Earth. Maybe somewhere\nin the universe, I thought, there would be peace for men. Somewhere\nbeyond the solar system, perhaps, someday when we had the means to go\nthere....\n  \n \n  Yet instinct told me that wasn't the answer, either. I thought of a\nverse by an ancient pre-atomic poet named Hoffenstein. (People had\nunwieldy, random combinations of letters for names in those days.) The\npoem went:\n  \n Wherever I go,\n  \n  I\n  \n go too,\n And spoil everything.\n  \n  That was it. The story of mankind.\n  \n \n  I turned the glowlight down and lay on the pneumo after a while, but I\ndidn't sleep for a long, long time.\n  \n \n  Then, when I did sleep, when I had been sleeping, I heard the voice\nagain. The low, seductive woman's voice—the startling, shocking voice\nout of my unconscious.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You have taken the first step\n   \n  ,\" she said. \"\n   \n   You are on your way\nto freedom. Don't stop now. Don't sink back into the lifelessness of\nconformity. Go on ... on and on. Keep struggling, for that is the only\nanswer....\n   \n  \"\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.

She says there were Great Ships built around 2025. The Great Ships and other things went into the Solar System in 2041. The humans that escaped established 112 colonies in the first 16 years.

In 2025, first of the eight Great Ships was finished. Then before 2041, 112 colonies were created. Mia believes that bringing horses to the colonies was an important factor that lead to the success of those colonies. Even those few planets could have had substitutes for horses, they had to be domesticated and trained. \n\nLater we acknowledge that Mia has learned about the Free Birthers in school. They destroyed Earth. Those Free Birthers basically just bred and spread, and the population on earth reached 8 billion. With so many people, resources became limited, which in the end lead to the war that destroyed Earth, and 8 billion people died along with the blow up of the Solar System. Thus, without those Free Birthers, there would never be 8 billion people on Earth, then the evac plan would never take place, and those 8 billion people would not have to die.

Those few who did contribute were awarded honors, decorations,\ntitles.\n  \n \n  Attired satisfactorily, Si double-checked to see that his credit\ncard was in his pocket. As an after-thought, he went over to the\nauto-apartment's teevee-phone, flicked it on, held the card to the\nscreen and said, \"Balance check, please.\"\n  \n \n  In a moment, the teevee-phone's robot voice reported, \"Ten shares of\nInalienable Basic. Twelve shares of Variable Basic, current value, four\nthousand, two hundred and thirty-three dollars and sixty-two cents\napiece. Current cash credit, one thousand and eighty-four dollars.\" The\nscreen went dead.\n  \n \n  One thousand and eighty-four dollars. That was plenty. He could safely\nspend as much as half of it, if the spree got as lively as he hoped it\nwould. His monthly dividends were due in another week or so, and he\nwouldn't have to worry about current expenses. Yes, indeedy, Si Pond\nwas as solvent as he had ever been in his thirty years.\n  \n \n  He opened the small, closet-like door which housed his vacuum-tube\ntwo-seater, and wedged himself into the small vehicle. He brought down\nthe canopy, dropped the pressurizer and considered the dial. Only one\nplace really made sense. The big city.\n  \n \n  He considered for a moment, decided against the boroughs of Baltimore\nand Boston, and selected Manhattan instead. He had the resources. He\nmight as well do it up brown.\n  \n \n  He dialed Manhattan and felt the sinking sensation that presaged his\ncar's dropping to tube level. While it was being taken up by the robot\ncontrols, being shuttled here and there preparatory to the shot to his\ndestination, he dialed the vehicle's teevee-phone for information on\nthe hotels of the island of the Hudson. He selected a swank hostelry\nhe'd read about and seen on the teevee casts of society and celebrity\ngossip reporters, and dialed it on the car's destination dial.\n  \n \n  \"Nothing too good for ex-Space Pilot Si Pond,\" he said aloud.\n  \n \n  The car hesitated for a moment, that brief hesitation before the\nshot, and Si took the involuntary breath from which only heroes could\nrefrain. He sank back slowly into the seat. Moments passed, and the\ndirection of the pressure was reversed.\n  \n \n  Manhattan. The shuttling began again, and one or two more traversing\nsub-shots. Finally, the dash threw a green light and Si opened the\ncanopy and stepped into his hotel room.\n  \n \n  A voice said gently, \"If the quarters are satisfactory, please present\nyour credit card within ten minutes.\"\n  \n \n  Si took his time. Not that he really needed it. It was by far the most\nswank suite he had ever seen. One wall was a window of whatever size\nthe guest might desire and Si touched the control that dilated it to\nthe full. His view opened in such wise that he could see both the\nEmpire State Building Museum and the Hudson. Beyond the river stretched\nthe all but endless city which was Greater Metropolis.\n  \n \n  He didn't take the time to flick on the menu, next to the auto-dining\ntable, nor to check the endless potables on the autobar list. All that,\nhe well knew, would be superlative. Besides, he didn't plan to dine\nor do much drinking in his suite. He made a mock leer. Not unless he\nmanaged to acquire some feminine companionship, that was.\n  \n \n  He looked briefly into the swimming pool and bath, then flopped\nhimself happily onto the bed. It wasn't up to the degree of softness\nhe presently desired, and he dialed the thing to the ultimate in that\ndirection so that with a laugh he sank almost out of sight into the\nmattress.\n  \n \n  He came back to his feet, gave his suit a quick patting so that it\nfell into press and, taking his credit card from his pocket, put it\nagainst the teevee-phone screen and pressed the hotel button so that\nregistration could be completed.\n  \n \n  For a moment he stood in the center of the floor, in thought. Take it\neasy, Si Pond, take it all easy, this time. No throwing his dollars\naround in second-class groggeries, no eating in automated luncheterias.\nThis time, be it the only time in his life, he was going to frolic in\nthe grand manner. No cloddy was Si Pond.\n  \n \n  He decided a drink was in order to help him plan his strategy. A drink\nat the hotel's famous Kudos Room where celebrities were reputed to be a\ndime a dozen.\n  \n \n  He left the suite and stepped into one of the elevators. He said,\n\"Kudos Room.\"\n  \n \n  The auto-elevator murmured politely, \"Yes, sir, the Kudos Room.\"\n\n[Chapter: SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_1]\nSPACEMAN ON A SPREE\n  \n \n  BY MACK REYNOLDS\n  \n \n  Illustrated by Nodel\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of Tomorrow June 1963\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  What's more important—Man's conquest\n   \n  of space, or one spaceman's life?\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  They gave him a gold watch. It was meant to be symbolical, of course.\nIn the old tradition. It was in the way of an antique, being one of the\ntimepieces made generations past in the Alpine area of Eur-Asia. Its\nquaintness lay in the fact that it was wound, not electronically by\npower-radio, but by the actual physical movements of the bearer, a free\nswinging rotor keeping the mainspring at a constant tension.\n  \n \n  They also had a banquet for him, complete with speeches by such\nbigwigs of the Department of Space Exploration as Academician Lofting\nGubelin and Doctor Hans Girard-Perregaux. There was also somebody\nfrom the government who spoke, but he was one of those who were\npseudo-elected and didn't know much about the field of space travel\nnor the significance of Seymour Pond's retirement. Si didn't bother to\nremember his name. He only wondered vaguely why the cloddy had turned\nup at all.\n  \n \n  In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations\nbefore him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible\nin the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to\nhis portfolio. But that, he supposed, was asking too much.\n  \n \n  The fact of the matter was, Si knew that his retiring had set them\nback. They hadn't figured he had enough shares of Basic to see him\nthrough decently. Well, possibly he didn't, given their standards.\nBut Space Pilot Seymour Pond didn't have their standards. He'd had\nplenty of time to think it over. It was better to retire on a limited\ncrediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or\nthree more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard.\n  \n \n  He'd had plenty of time to figure it out, there alone in space on the\nMoon run, there on the Venus or Mars runs. There on the long, long\nhaul to the Jupiter satellites, fearfully checking the symptoms of\nspace cafard, the madness compounded of claustrophobia, monotony,\nboredom and free fall. Plenty of time. Time to decide that a one\nroom mini-auto-apartment, complete with an autochair and built-in\nautobar, and with one wall a teevee screen, was all he needed to\nfind contentment for a mighty long time. Possibly somebody like\nDoc Girard-Perregaux might be horrified at the idea of living in a\nmini-auto-apartment ... not realizing that to a pilot it was roomy\nbeyond belief compared to the conning tower of a space craft.\n  \n \n  No. Even as Si listened to their speeches, accepted the watch and\nmade a halting little talk of his own, he was grinning inwardly. There\nwasn't anything they could do. He had them now. He had enough Basic to\nkeep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He\nwas never going to subject himself to space cafard again. Just thinking\nabout it, now, set the tic to going at the side of his mouth.\n  \n \n  They could count down and blast off, for all he gave a damn.\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_5]\nWhen the three animals went back to join the rest of their group, the\nfirst two resumed walking. Purnie followed along.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Benson, you won't have to look far for materials to use for the\nbase of the flag pole. Look at that rockpile up there.\n  \n \n  \"Can't use them. They're petrified logs. The ones on top are too high\nto carry down, and if we move those on the bottom, the whole works will\nslide down on top of us.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well—that's your problem. Just remember, I want this flag pole to be\nsolid. It's got to stand at least—\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't worry, Forbes, we'll get your monument erected. What's this with\nthe flag? There must be more to staking a claim than just putting up a\nflag.\"\n  \n \n  \"There is, there is. Much more. I've taken care of all requirements set\ndown by law to make my claim. But the flag? Well, you might say it\nrepresents an empire, Benson. The Forbes Empire. On each of my flags\nis the word FORBES, a symbol of development and progress. Call it\nsentiment if you will.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't worry, I won't. I've seen real-estate flags before.\"\n  \n \n  \"Damn it all, will you stop referring to this as a real-estate deal?\nWhat I'm doing is big, man. Big! This is pioneering.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course. And if I'm not mistaken, you've set up a neat little escrow\nsystem so that you not only own the planets, but you will virtually own\nthe people who are foolish enough to buy land on them.\"\n  \n \n  \"I could have your hide for talking to me like this. Damn you, man!\nIt's people like me who pay your way. It's people like me who give your\nspace ships some place to go. It's people like me who pour good money\ninto a chancey job like this, so that people like you can get away from\nthirteen-story tenement houses. Did you ever think of that?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine you'll triple your money in six months.\"\n  \n \n  When they stopped, Purnie stopped. At first he had been interested in\nthe strange sounds they were making, but as he grew used to them, and\nas they in turn ignored his presence, he hopped alongside chattering to\nhimself, content to be in their company.\n  \n \n  He heard more of these sounds coming from behind, and he turned to see\nthe remainder of the group running toward them.\n  \n \n  \"Captain Benson! Here's the flag, sir. And here's Miles with the\nscintillometer. He says the radiation's getting stronger over this way!\"\n  \n \n  \"How about that, Miles?\"\n  \n \n  \"This thing's going wild, Captain. It's almost off scale.\"\n\n[Chapter: SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_3]\nGirard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\nseemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\nthe conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\nman.\n  \n \n  He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\nalways paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\nactuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\nthe least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one\nneed face danger—ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the\nfact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n  \n \n  His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's\nleave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the\npoint. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\ntake months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\npilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\nexplorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\nincreasingly hard to come by—even though in\n   \n   our\n   \n  minds, Hans, we are\nnear important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\nspark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\nhold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\nto the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be\nthat the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\non Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\nExploration.\"\n  \n \n  \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\n  \n \n  \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\nLooking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\nface took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\njustify the means?\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin blinked at him.\n  \n \n  The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\nfailed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read\nof the sailor and his way of life?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\ndo with it?\"\n  \n \n  \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\nthan a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\ntendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\nheard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\nbirth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\nsea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\nfor years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\nof his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\none short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\nheading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\nwould find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\njail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\ncan't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd\npersonally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\nthe head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n  \n \n  He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\nuniversal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\n\"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself. Nobody can steal it,\nnobody can, ah,\n   \n   con\n   \n  you out of it. Just how do you expect to sever\nour present-day sailor and his accumulated nest egg?\"\n  \n \n  The other chuckled again. \"It is simply a matter of finding more modern\nmethods, my dear chap.\"\n\n[Chapter: SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_2]\nThe gold watch idea had been that of Lofting Gubelin, which was\ntypical, he being in the way of a living anachronism himself. In fact,\nAcademician Gubelin was possibly the only living man on North America\nwho still wore spectacles. His explanation was that a phobia against\nhaving his eyes touched prohibited either surgery to remould his\neyeballs and cure his myopia, or contact lenses.\n  \n \n  That was only an alibi so far as his closest associate, Hans\nGirard-Perregaux, was concerned. Doctor Girard-Perregaux was convinced\nGubelin would have even worn facial hair, had he but a touch more\ncourage. Gubelin longed for yesteryear, a seldom found phenomenon under\nthe Ultrawelfare State.\n  \n \n  Slumped in an autochair in the escape room of his Floridian home,\nLofting Gubelin scowled at his friend. He said, acidly, \"Any more\nbright schemes, Hans? I presume you now acknowledge that appealing to\nthe cloddy's patriotism, sentiment and desire for public acclaim have\nmiserably failed.\"\n  \n \n  Girard-Perregaux said easily, \"I wouldn't call Seymour Pond a cloddy.\nIn his position, I am afraid I would do the same thing he has.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's nonsense, Hans. Zoroaster! Either you or I would gladly take\nPond's place were we capable of performing the duties for which he has\nbeen trained. There aren't two men on North America—there aren't two\nmen in the world!—who better realize the urgency of continuing our\ndelving into space.\" Gubelin snapped his fingers. \"Like that, either of\nus would give our lives to prevent man from completely abandoning the\nroad to his destiny.\"\n  \n \n  His friend said drily, \"Either of us could have volunteered for pilot\ntraining forty years ago, Lofting. We didn't.\"\n  \n \n  \"At that time there wasn't such a blistering percentage of funkers\nthroughout this whole blistering Ultrawelfare State! Who could\nforesee that eventually our whole program would face ending due to\nlack of courageous young men willing to take chances, willing to face\nadventure, willing to react to the stimulus of danger in the manner our\nancestors did?\"\n  \n \n  Girard-Perregaux grunted his sarcasm and dialed a glass of iced tea\nand tequila. He said, \"Nevertheless, both you and I conform with the\npresent generation in finding it far more pleasant to follow one's\nway of life in the comfort of one's home than to be confronted with\nthe unpleasantness of facing nature's dangers in more adventurous\npastimes.\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin, half angry at his friend's argument, leaned forward to snap\nrebuttal, but the other was wagging a finger at him negatively. \"Face\nreality, Lofting. Don't require or expect from Seymour Pond more\nthan is to be found there. He is an average young man. Born in our\nUltrawelfare State, he was guaranteed his fundamental womb-to-tomb\nsecurity by being issued that minimum number of Basic shares in our\nsociety that allows him an income sufficient to secure the food,\nclothing, shelter, medical care and education to sustain a low level\nof subsistence. Percentages were against his ever being drafted\ninto industry. Automation being what it is, only a fraction of the\npopulation is ever called up. But Pond was. His industrial aptitude\ndossier revealed him a possible candidate for space pilot, and it was\nyou yourself who talked him into taking the training ... pointing out\nthe more pragmatic advantages such as complete retirement after but six\ntrips, added shares of Basic so that he could enjoy a more comfortable\nlife than most and the fame that would accrue to him as one of the\nvery few who still participate in travel to the planets. Very well.\nHe was sold. Took his training, which, of course, required long years\nof drudgery to him. Then, performing his duties quite competently, he\nmade his six trips. He is now legally eligible for retirement. He was\ndrafted into the working force reserves, served his time, and is now\nfree from toil for the balance of his life. Why should he listen to\nour pleas for a few more trips?\"\n  \n \n  \"But has he no spirit of adventure? Has he no feeling for....\"\n\n[Chapter: SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_7]\nShe looked down into the drink the bartender had placed before her,\nas though avoiding his face. \"I ... I suppose it was that speech\nDoctor Girard-Perregaux made. There you stood, so fine and straight in\nyour space-pilot uniform, the veteran of six exploration runs to the\nplanets....\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Si said modestly, \"two of my runs were only to the Moon.\"\n  \n \n  \"... and he said all those things about man's conquest of space. And\nthe dream of the stars which man has held so long. And then the fact\nthat you were the last of the space pilots. The last man in the whole\nworld trained to pilot a space craft. And here you were, retiring.\"\n  \n \n  Si grunted. \"Yeah. That's all part of the Doc's scheme to get me to\ntake on another three runs. They're afraid the whole department'll be\ndropped by the Appropriations Committee on this here Economic Planning\nBoard. Even if they can find some other patsy to train for the job,\nit'd take maybe a year before you could even send him on a Moon hop.\nSo old man Gubelin, and Girard-Perregaux too, they're both trying to\npressure me into more trips. Otherwise they got a Space Exploration\nDepartment, with all the expense and all, but nobody to pilot their\nships. It's kind of funny, in a way. You know what one of those\nspaceships costs?\"\n  \n \n  \"Funny?\" she said. \"Why, I don't think it's funny at all.\"\n  \n \n  Si said, \"Look, how about another drink?\"\n  \n \n  Natalie Paskov said, \"Oh, I'd love to have a drink with you, Mr....\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Si,\" Si said. He motioned to the bartender with a circular twist of\nthe hand indicating their need for two more of the same. \"How come you\nknow so much about it? You don't meet many people who are interested\nin space any more. In fact, most people are almost contemptuous, like.\nThink it's kind of a big boondoggle deal to help use up a lot of\nmaterials and all and keep the economy going.\"\n  \n \n  Natalie said earnestly, \"Why, I've been a space fan all my life. I've\nread all about it. Have always known the names of all the space pilots\nand everything about them, ever since I was a child. I suppose you'd\nsay I have the dream that Doctor Girard-Perregaux spoke about.\"\n  \n \n  Si chuckled. \"A real buff, eh? You know, it's kind of funny. I was\nnever much interested in it. And I got a darn sight less interested\nafter my first run and I found out what space cafard was.\"\n  \n \n  She frowned. \"I don't believe I know much about that.\"\n  \n \n  Sitting in the Kudos Room with the most beautiful girl to whom he had\never talked, Si could be nonchalant about the subject. \"Old Gubelin\nkeeps that angle mostly hushed up and out of the magazine and newspaper\narticles. Says there's enough adverse publicity about space exploration\nalready. But at this stage of the game when the whole ship's crammed\ntight with this automatic scientific apparatus and all, there's\nprecious little room in the conning tower and you're the only man\naboard. The Doc says later on when ships are bigger and there's a whole\nflock of people aboard, there won't be any such thing as space cafard,\nbut....\" Of a sudden the right side of Si Pond's mouth began to tic\nand he hurriedly took up his drink and knocked it back.\n\n[Chapter: SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_6]\nAt the door to the famous rendezvous of the swankiest set, Si paused a\nmoment and looked about. He'd never been in a place like this, either.\nHowever, he stifled his first instinct to wonder about what this was\ngoing to do to his current credit balance with an inner grin and made\nhis way to the bar.\n  \n \n  There was actually a bartender.\n  \n \n  Si Pond suppressed his astonishment and said, offhand, attempting an\nair of easy sophistication, \"Slivovitz Sour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  The drinks in the Kudos Room might be concocted by hand, but Si noticed\nthey had the routine teevee screens built into the bar for payment.\nHe put his credit card on the screen immediately before him when the\ndrink came, and had to quell his desire to dial for a balance check, so\nas to be able to figure out what the Sour had cost him.\n  \n \n  Well, this was something like it. This was the sort of thing he'd\ndreamed about, out there in the great alone, seated in the confining\nconning tower of his space craft. He sipped at the drink, finding it up\nto his highest expectations, and then swiveled slightly on his stool to\ntake a look at the others present.\n  \n \n  To his disappointment, there were no recognizable celebrities. None\nthat he placed, at least—top teevee stars, top politicians of the\nUltrawelfare State or Sports personalities.\n  \n \n  He turned back to his drink and noticed, for the first time, the girl\nwho occupied the stool two down from him. Si Pond blinked. He blinked\nand then swallowed.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Zo-ro-as-ter\n   \n  ,\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  She was done in the latest style from Shanghai, even to the point of\nhaving cosmetically duplicated the Mongolian fold at the corners of her\neyes. Every pore, but\n   \n   every\n   \n  pore, was in place. She sat with the easy\ngrace of the Orient, so seldom found in the West.\n  \n \n  His stare couldn't be ignored.\n  \n \n  She looked at him coldly, turned to the bartender and murmured, \"A Far\nOut Cooler, please, Fredric.\" Then deliberately added, \"I thought the\nKudos Room was supposed to be exclusive.\"\n  \n \n  There was nothing the bartender could say to that, and he went about\nbuilding the drink.\n  \n \n  Si cleared his throat. \"Hey,\" he said, \"how about letting this one be\non me?\"\n  \n \n  Her eyebrows, which had been plucked and penciled to carry out her\nOriental motif, rose. \"Really!\" she said, drawing it out.\n  \n \n  The bartender said hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon, sir....\"\n  \n \n  The girl, her voice suddenly subtly changed, said, \"Why, isn't that a\nspace pin?\"\n  \n \n  Si, disconcerted by the sudden reversal, said, \"Yeah ... sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good Heavens, you're a spaceman?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure.\" He pointed at the lapel pin. \"You can't wear one unless you\nbeen on at least a Moon run.\"\n  \n \n  She was obviously both taken back and impressed. \"Why,\" she said,\n\"you're Seymour Pond, the pilot. I tuned in on the banquet they gave\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Si, carrying his glass, moved over to the stool next to her. \"Call me\nSi,\" he said. \"Everybody calls me Si.\"\n  \n \n  She said, \"I'm Natalie. Natalie Paskov. Just Natalie. Imagine meeting\nSeymour Pond. Just sitting down next to him at a bar. Just like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Si,\" Si said, gratified. Holy Zoroaster, he'd never seen anything\nlike this rarified pulchritude. Maybe on teevee, of course, one of the\ncurrent sex symbols, but never in person. \"Call me Si,\" he said again.\n\"I been called Si so long, I don't even know who somebody's talking to\nif they say Seymour.\"\n  \n \n  \"I cried when they gave you that antique watch,\" she said, her tone\nsuch that it was obvious she hadn't quite adjusted as yet to having\nmet him.\n  \n \n  Si Pond was surprised. \"Cried?\" he said. \"Well, why? I was kind of\nbored with the whole thing. But old Doc Gubelin, I used to work under\nhim in the Space Exploration department, he was hot for it.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Academician\n   \n  Gubelin?\" she said. \"You just call him\n   \n   Doc\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Si was expansive. \"Why, sure. In the Space Department we don't have\nmuch time for formality. Everybody's just Si, and Doc, and Jim. Like\nthat. But how come you cried?\"\n\n[Chapter: SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_4]\nII\n  \n \n  Si Pond was a great believer in the institution of the spree. Any\nexcuse would do. Back when he had finished basic education at the age\nof twenty-five and was registered for the labor draft, there hadn't\nbeen a chance in a hundred that he'd have the bad luck to have his\nname pulled. But when it had been, Si had celebrated.\n  \n \n  When he had been informed that his physical and mental qualifications\nwere such that he was eligible for the most dangerous occupation in\nthe Ultrawelfare State and had been pressured into taking training\nfor space pilot, he had celebrated once again. Twenty-two others had\ntaken the training with him, and only he and Rod Cameroon had passed\nthe finals. On this occasion, he and Rod had celebrated together. It\nhad been quite a party. Two weeks later, Rod had burned on a faulty\ntake-off on what should have been a routine Moon run.\n  \n \n  Each time Si returned from one of his own runs, he celebrated. A spree,\na bust, a bat, a wing-ding, a night on the town. A commemoration of\ndangers met and passed.\n  \n \n  Now it was all over. At the age of thirty he was retired. Law prevented\nhim from ever being called up for contributing to the country's labor\nneeds again. And he most certainly wasn't going to volunteer.\n  \n \n  He had taken his schooling much as had his contemporaries. There wasn't\nany particular reason for trying to excell. You didn't want to get the\nreputation for being a wise guy, or a cloddy either. Just one of the\nfellas. You could do the same in life whether you really studied or\nnot. You had your Inalienable Basic stock, didn't you? What else did\nyou need?\n  \n \n  It had come as a surprise when he'd been drafted for the labor force.\n  \n \n  In the early days of the Ultrawelfare State, they had made a mistake\nin adapting to the automation of the second industrial revolution.\nThey had attempted to give everyone work by reducing the number of\nworking hours in the day, and the number of working days in the week.\nIt finally became ludicrous when employees of industry were working\nbut two days a week, two hours a day. In fact, it got chaotic. It\nbecame obvious that it was more practical to have one worker putting in\nthirty-five hours a week and getting to know his job well, than it was\nto have a score of employees, each working a few hours a week and none\nof them ever really becoming efficient.\n  \n \n  The only fair thing was to let the technologically unemployed remain\nunemployed, with their Inalienable Basic stock as the equivalent of\nunemployment insurance, while the few workers still needed put in a\nreasonable number of hours a day, a reasonable number of weeks a year\nand a reasonable number of years in a life time. When new employees\nwere needed, a draft lottery was held.\n  \n \n  All persons registered in the labor force participated. If you\nwere drawn, you must need serve. The dissatisfaction those chosen\nmight feel at their poor luck was offset by the fact that they were\ngranted additional Variable Basic shares, according to the tasks\nthey fulfilled. Such shares could be added to their portfolios, the\ndividends becoming part of their current credit balance, or could be\nsold for a lump sum on the market.\n  \n \n  Yes, but now it was all over. He had his own little place, his own\nvacuum-tube vehicle and twice the amount of shares of Basic that most\nof his fellow citizens could boast. Si Pond had it made. A spree was\nobviously called for.\n  \n \n  He was going to do this one right. This was the big one. He'd\naccumulated a lot of dollars these past few months and he intended\nto blow them, or at least a sizeable number of them. His credit card\nwas burning a hole in his pocket, as the expression went. However, he\nwasn't going to rush into things. This had to be done correctly.\n  \n \n  Too many a spree was played by ear. You started off with a few drinks,\nfell in with some second rate mopsy and usually wound up in a third\nrate groggery where you spent just as much as though you'd been in the\nclassiest joint in town. Came morning and you had nothing to show for\nall the dollars that had been spent but a rum-head.\n  \n \n  Thus, Si was vaguely aware, it had always been down through the\ncenturies since the Phoenecian sailor, back from his year-long trip to\nthe tin mines of Cornwall, blew his hard earned share of the voyage's\nprofits in a matter of days in the wine shops of Tyre. Nobody gets\nquite so little for his money as that loneliest of all workers, he who\nmust leave his home for distant lands, returning only periodically and\nusually with the salary of lengthy, weary periods of time to be spent\nhurriedly in an attempt to achieve the pleasure and happiness so long\ndenied him.\n  \n \n  Si was going to do it differently this time.\n  \n \n  Nothing but the best. Wine, women, song, food, entertainment. The\nworks. But nothing but the best.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Pond's attitude toward wealth is pragmatic and modest compared to societal standards. He prefers tangible rewards over symbolic ones, as shown by his reaction to his retirement gift:  \n##begin_quote## In common with recipients of gold watches of a score of generations before him, Si Pond would have preferred something a bit more tangible in the way of reward, such as a few shares of Variable Basic to add to his portfolio. ##end_quote##\n\n2. He is content with a simple, comfortable life, valuing security over luxury or risk. He consciously chooses to retire with what he has, rather than risk his health or sanity for more wealth or status:  \n##begin_quote## It was better to retire on a limited crediting, on a confoundedly limited crediting, than to take the two or three more trips in hopes of attaining a higher standard. ##end_quote##\n\n3. Pond is aware of the prestige attached to his role but does not seem obsessed with fame. He enjoys some of the perks and recognition, but his actions show he is more interested in comfort and personal satisfaction:  \n##begin_quote## He had enough Basic to keep him comfortably, by his standards, for the rest of his life. He was never going to subject himself to space cafard again. ##end_quote##\n\n##Answer: Pond values wealth primarily as a means to secure a modest, comfortable, and risk-free life, rather than for luxury or status.

At his retirement, he is given a gold watch. He thinks to himself how much better it would have been if they had simply given him money instead. He vows to live a simple, comfortable life, keeping an eye on his money so it will last him for the rest of his days. He is very proud of the fact that he can afford a luxury like his vacuum tube. Whenever something goes well in Pond's life, he loves to splurge on a night out. He ends up spending enormous amounts of money on things that he sometimes deems as \"sub-par\" for a man of his status. On this one fateful night, he decides that he deserves the best of everything. He is obsessed with the idea of wealth and fame, and checks himself into the nicest hotel he can think of in New York City, partially because he presumes he might see some celebrities there. He checks the balance on his credit card often, and when he goes down to the hotel bar, he has to restrain himself from checking how much a single drink costs. He looks around for signs of famous people, but is disappointed when he sees none. He gives into the flattery of Natalie when she gushes over him, as if he were famous, believing her obvious depciet, and buying her a drink. Fame and money are everything to Pond. ", "In comparison to the gold clock, Pond prefers Variable Basic shares which can be used as money. He does not want to be extremely wealthy, a one room mini-auto-apartment along with an autochair, built-in autobar, a teevee screen is enough for him. With the six trips to space, he has enough money for a comfortable life; he does not want more wealth, which can be obtained from going on more trip. But he keeps on warning himself about not spending too much money so quickly, since he has been doing that multiple times before. Moreover, he believes that reputation for being a wise guy or for being a cloddy is not good since there is the Inalienable Basic stock. However he still wears his air force pin on his suit. ", "Seymour Pond expresses content with the basic necessities of life. He appreciates receiving more than the standard, but he is capable of being content and not needing endless excess. He seems to be content with the rations that he has accumulated but is also okay with benefitting from his wealth and fame that has come from his occupation as a space pilot. He notes that he can get preferential treatment when out of town due to his prestige as a space pilot. Seymour does not need luxurious living conditions as he was used to living in a tiny vacuum-tube vehicle during his space runs. He continuously has a desire to check his account balance even though he has a share of money larger than most people. ", "Pond wants the dangerous job of a space pilot while no-one wants to risk and everyone is fine with the minimum fortune and unemployment. He wants fame and money at first, but during the actual trips he dreams of retirement and comfort. He  doesn't want any more trips even if they bring more wealth, he is good with small auto-apartment with a TV and having some good entertainment. This comfort is just enough for him, more than some have, and he is not greedy to desire for more. But he also enjoys this money he has and wants to spend them wisely. "]}}
