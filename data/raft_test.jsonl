He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_5]\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n  \n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n  \n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n  \n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n  \n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n  \n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n  \n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n  \n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n  \n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n  \n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n  \n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n  \n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n  \n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n  \n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n  \n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n  \n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n  \n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n  \n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n  \n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_6]\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n  \n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n  \n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n  \n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n  \n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n  \n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n  \n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n  \n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n  \n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n  \n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n  \n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n  \n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n  \n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n  \n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n  \n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_8]\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n  \n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n  \n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n  \n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n  \n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n  \n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n  \n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n  \n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n  \n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n  \n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n  \n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n  \n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n  \n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_1]\nRaiders of the Second Moon\n  \n \n  By GENE ELLERMAN\n  \n \n  A strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_4]\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n  \n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n  \n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n  \n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n  \n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n  \n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n  \n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n  \n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n  \n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n  \n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n  \n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n  \n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n  \n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n  \n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n  \n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n  \n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n  \n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n  \n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_2]\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n  \n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n  \n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n  \n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n  \n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n  \n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n  \n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n  \n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\n  \n \n \n  Noork\n  \n \n \n  At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n  \n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n  \n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n  \n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n  \n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n  \n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n  \n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n  \n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n  \n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_7]\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n  \n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n  \n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n  \n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n  \n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n  \n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n  \n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n  \n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n  \n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\n\n[Chapter: DUST_UNTO_DUST_1]\nDUST UNTO DUST\n  \n \n  By LYMAN D. HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city—even a city like this one—in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet—the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis—was—for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not—not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the—well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering—\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out—and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen—\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively—\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw—I thought I\nsaw—something—moving—\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That—\"\n  \n \n  \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The plot follows a man named Noork, who has amnesia and finds himself on a remote moon called Sekk.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Setup and Amnesia**\nThe story begins with Noork, a man with no memory of his past, living as a \"white savage\" in the jungles of Sekk.

When they speak, they learn that Noork has been living with her brother, Gurn.  With this introduction, they begin to travel together.\n\nThe woman explains that she had been captured by slavers in the past but had escaped.  The escapees were then followed by the Misty Ones, and the woman was the only one who made a complete escape.  Noork states that he will visit the island where the Misty Ones live one day, but the woman does not answer. When Noork turns back to her, she has disappeared, and Noork is attacked.  He hides in the trees and spies the Misty Ones below.  He throws fruit down on them until he can easily see them by the stains the fruit makes on their clothing, then attacks with arrows.  The Misty Ones flee except for one who has been killed with an arrow.  Noork takes the robe of this one and sets off toward the Temple of the Skull, the home of the Misty Ones, to free the woman.\n\nNoork encounters Ud, his friend, near the lake, and tells him to tell Gurn that the MIsty Ones can be trapped and skinned.  He asks Ud to tell Gurn that Noork is going to save Gurn's \"father's woman woman\" called Sarna.\n\nNoork paddles across the lake and sneaks close to the Temple of the Skull.  He falls asleep in a tree and is awakened by the conversation of two slaves talking about Sarna.  After one slave leaves, he speaks with the other slave, Rold, and tells him that he is there to rescue Sarna.  Rold, realizing that the Misty Ones are only mortal men, tells Noork that Sarna is held in a pit beneath the temple with the other young women slaves.\n\nNoork finds the entrance to the pit but is blocked by two guards, whom he kills.He then proceeds to the cage where the young women are held, where he is confronted by a priest.

They plan to go for a boat and leave, but are caught by Misty Ones waiting to trap them.  At this time, Dr. Von Mark, a Nazi from Earth, confronts Noork, who is also Stephen Dietrich, an American pilot who has been hunting him and had tracked him through space to Sekk.  Due to Dietrich/Noork's amnesia, he remembers none of this.  Just as Von Mark is about to kill him, Gurn and other men from Wari kill the Misty Ones with arrows and Noork and the others are freed.  Noork states that he can now live in peace with Gurn and Sarna in the jungle.", "Noork, a man from Earth who doesn’t remember who he is, lives in the jungle on a second moon. He knows he was brought there by what he remembers as a huge bird and that he was taken in by a man named Gurn and the Vasad people of the jungle. He meets a woman named Sarna with whom he shares a mutual attraction, and it turns out that she is Gurn’s sister. Shortly after they discover this, they are attacked. Sarna vanishes and Noork hides, eventually discovering that the “Misty Ones” who attacked them, thought to be demons, look similar to him and can be “skinned”; this is important because their skins or coverings allow the wearer to be nearly invisible like them. \n\nNoork passes a message along via another Vasad to tell Gurn what he has learned about the Misty Ones, and to say that Noork has gone to rescue Sarna. He sneaks into the walled temple where the slaves are being kept, and enlists the help of another slave, Rold, to help them get out if he can get Sarna. Noork goes down to the cavern and, after fighting a priest to the death, rescues Sarna. They escape with Rold, only to be captured by more Misty Ones, one of whom turns out to be a Nazi from Noork’s previous life. \n\nThough Noork can’t remember him (but knows he dislikes him), Doctor Von Mark remembers him. Noork’s name was Stephen Dietrich, and he was an American flier who had chased down one of the last nazi criminals: Doctor Von Mark. Von Mark had then flown one of his shuttles to Sekk and landed successfully, while Stephen had pursued him in another of his shuttles and crashed on Sekk, resulting in his amnesia. “Noork” was the name given to him by the Vasad based on the only sounds he could make: “New York”. \n\nDoctor Von Mark asks if Noork knows the secret to the invisibility of the Misty One’s skins, since this would allow him to return to Earth and take it over for the Fatherland. When he realizes that Noork knows nothing, he moves to kill him but is shot by an arrow just in time. Gurn has rallied warriors based on Noork’s message. Noork now knows his real name and that he got where he is by hunting down an evil man. He is now happy to live safely in the jungle with Gurn and Sarna, and she says she is happy, too. \n", "Noork is a man from Earth whose real name is Stephen Dietrich; he was pursuing the Nazi Dr. Karl Von Mark, the last of the Axis criminals at large. Dietrich followed Von Mark to Africa where Von Mark took off in a spaceship, and Dietrich followed. Both landed on Sekk, a second moon past Luna, but Dietrich’s landing was so rough that he lost his memory. When the locals found him, he said, “New York,” which they didn’t understand and named him Noork. Noork lives among the Vasads and learns their language. \n\nNoork and Tholon Sarna meet in the jungle and become friends. One day as they are talking, Noork hears feet scuffing, and Tholon disappears. Noork climbs a tree to find out where the Misty Ones are (They are invisible.). He detects movement and throws overripe fruit, which stains the cloaks of the Misty Ones. Noork shoots arrows toward the creatures and kills one. He takes that one’s robe, which is what makes the Misty Ones invisible. \n\nNoork tells one of his colleagues to take the message to Gurn, their leader and Tholon’s brother, that the Misty Ones are flesh and blood, not demons as they believe. He tells Ud that he is going to the island of the Misty Ones to save Tholon. He reaches the wall surrounding the Misty Ones’ village and overhears two slaves talking before they separate. Noork approaches the slave in the field, Rold, and asks for his help in exchange for helping Rold escape. Rold explains that the large skull is the god Uzdon, and the priests make sacrifices by taking the heart out of a living slave girl. He also tells Noork that the slave girls are held in a pit beneath the skull guarded by Misty Ones.\n\nNoork moves among the Misty Ones in anonymity since he is wearing one of their robes. He enters the skull and kills the guards who are in charge of the slave girls. Just as he is about to release Tholon, a priest catches him, and they fight until Noork kills him, too. Noork takes more robes and the priest’s face shield and leaves with Tholon and Rold. The face shield enables him to see the Misty Ones who are invisible to everyone else, so he can see when they are waiting to trap them. They capture the escape party, and one of the Misty Ones reveals that he is Dr. Von Mark after recognizing Dietrich. Von Mark reveals his plans to use the cloaks of invisibility to conquer Earth and make Germany invincible. Von Mark prepares to shoot Dietrich but is shot by an arrow first. Misty Ones close in on the group and lower their hoods, revealing Tholon’s brother Gurn and his men. Noork now remembers who he is and says he will live in peace with Gurn and his sister.\n", "Noork searches for the bird that dropped him on a cliff (as well as another bird) when he is discovered by the Vasads. He repeated the word \"New York\", and so the Vasads call him Noork. From his perch, he now watches a girl—Tholon Sarna--moving along a trail below. She is the sister of Gurn, the Vasad leader. Gurn has been exiled from their home city of Grath because he doesn't believe in the enslavement of the Zuran, and Tholon Sarna has recently evaded capture by her enemies, the men of Konto. The Misty Ones--slavers dwellling at the Temple of the Skull and feared deeply by the Vasads--follow her. As Tholon Sarna and Noork walk, she is captured by a Misty One made invisible by a special robe. A Misty One clubs Noork, injuring his arm. Thanks to their blurry outlines, Noork realizes the Misty Ones are not entirely invisible, and he uses his legs to pelt them with fruit. Upon seeing their true form--closer to his own human shape--Noork loses his fear of them and begins attacking them with arrows. He takes the invisibility robe of a fallen Misty One and uses it to disguise himself as he makes his way to the Temple of the Skull. Along the way, he reunites with his friend Ud, a jungle-dwelling beast-man. He sends Ud to inform Gurn of the Misty Ones' newfound weakness. We then learn that Noork's real name is Stephen Dietrich, and he had been hunting Dr. Karl Von Mark, a criminal scientist attempting to revivify the Nazi power structure. Von Mark manages to evade Dietrich by landing on Sekk, and Dietrich crashes and succumbs to amnesia. The bird that had carried him to the cliff was his own plane, and the bird he had been seeking was Von Mark's. Now, Noork descends upon a slave named Rold near the Temple of the Skull. He enlists Rold to help him free Tholon Sarna. Rold informs Noork of the High Priest's plan to choose a sacrifice to their god, Uzdon, from the female slaves caged in a pit beneath the Skull. Noork promises a robe to Rold if his plan to rescue Tholon Sarna succeeds. In disguise, Noork approaches the Skull, heavily guarded by Misty Ones, and makes his way toward the pit. Along the way, he defeats guards and pockets two robes. Before freeing Tholon Sarna, Noork battles the High Priest, kills him, and they make their escape. Soon after, they are again trapped by a group of Misty Ones--this time led by none other than Dr. Karl Von Mark himself. Von Mark tells Noork of his desire to use the secret of invisibility to make Germany all-powerful, and he pulls out a gun to kill him. Suddenly, Gurn emerges with the Vasads, and they kill Von Mark with arrows. Noork recalls his true identify as Captain Dietrich and looks forward to a life of peace amongst the Vasads with Tholon Sarna."]}}

Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n  \n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n  \n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n  \n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n  \n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n  \n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n  \n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n  \n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n  \n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n  \n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n  \n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n  \n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n  \n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n  \n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n  \n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n  \n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n  \n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n  \n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n  \n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_2]\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n  \n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n  \n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n  \n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n  \n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n  \n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n  \n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n  \n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\n  \n \n \n  Noork\n  \n \n \n  At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n  \n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n  \n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n  \n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n  \n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n  \n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n  \n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n  \n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n  \n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_3]\nUd tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from\nshoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.\nFor between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and\nthe golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal\nwar.\n  \n \n  A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_8]\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n  \n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n  \n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n  \n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n  \n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n  \n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n  \n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n  \n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n  \n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n  \n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n  \n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n  \n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n  \n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_7]\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n  \n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n  \n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n  \n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n  \n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n  \n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n  \n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n  \n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n  \n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_1]\nRaiders of the Second Moon\n  \n \n  By GENE ELLERMAN\n  \n \n  A strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_6]\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n  \n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n  \n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n  \n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n  \n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n  \n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n  \n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n  \n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n  \n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n  \n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n  \n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n  \n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n  \n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n  \n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n  \n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_4]\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n  \n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n  \n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n  \n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n  \n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n  \n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n  \n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n  \n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n  \n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n  \n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n  \n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n  \n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n  \n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n  \n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n  \n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n  \n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n  \n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n  \n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\n\n[Chapter: A_PLANET_NAMED_JOE_5]\nWhen we'd been out for a while I discovered why Joe had suggested the\nboots and the hat. The undergrowth was often sharp and jagged and it\nwould have sliced my legs to ribbons were they not protected by the\nhigh boots. The hat kept the strong sun off my head.\n  \n \n  Joe was an excellent guide and a pleasant companion. He seemed to be\nenjoying a great romp, seemed to love the jungle and take a secret\npleasure in the work he was doing. There were times when I couldn't\nsee three feet ahead of me. He'd stand stock still for a few minutes,\nhis head barely moving, his eyes darting from one plant to another.\nThen he'd say, \"This way,\" and take off into what looked like more\nimpenetrable jungle invariably to find a little path leading directly\nto another village.\n  \n \n  Each village was the same. The natives would come running out of their\nhuts, tall and blue, shouting, \"Cigarettes, Joe? Cigarettes?\" It took\nme a while to realize they were addressing me and not my guide.\n  \n \n  Everybody was Joe. It was one beautiful, happy, joyous round of\nstinking, hot jungle. And I wasn't getting any nearer my man. Nor had\nI any idea how I was supposed to find him. I began to feel pretty low\nabout the whole affair.\n  \n \n  Joe, on the other hand, enjoyed every moment of the trip. In each\nvillage he greeted the natives cheerfully, told them stories, swapped\ngossip and jokes. And when it was time to leave, he would say goodbye\nto all his friends and we would plunge into the twisted foliage again.\n  \n \n  His spirits were always high and he never failed to say the right thing\nthat would give a momentary lift to my own depressed state of mind. He\nwould talk for hours on end as we hacked our way through the jungle.\n  \n \n  \"I like Venus,\" he said once. \"I would never leave it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you ever been to Earth?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" Joe replied. \"I like Terrans too, you understand. They are good\nfor Venus. And they are fun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fun?\" I asked, thinking of a particular species of Terran: species\nLeonard Walsh.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes,\" he said wholeheartedly. \"They joke and they laugh and ...\nwell, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so,\" I admitted.\n  \n \n  Joe smiled secretly, and we pushed on. I began to find, more and more,\nthat I had started to talk freely to Joe. In the beginning he had been\njust my guide. There had been the strained relationship of employer and\nemployee. But as the days lengthened into weeks, the formal atmosphere\nbegan to crumble. I found myself telling him all about Earth, about\nthe people there, about my decision to attend the Academy, the rigid\ntests, the grind, even the Moon run. Joe was a good listener, nodding\nsympathetically, finding experiences in his own life to parallel my own.\n  \n \n  And as our relationship progressed from a casual one to a definitely\nfriendly one, Joe seemed more enthusiastic than ever to keep up our\ngrinding pace to find what we were looking for.\n  \n \n  Once we stopped in a clearing to rest. Joe lounged on the matted\ngreenery, his long body stretched out in front of him, the knife\ngleaming in his belt. I'd seen him slash his way through thick, tangled\nvines with that knife, his long, muscular arms powerfully slicing\nthrough them like strips of silk.\n  \n \n  \"How far are we from the Station?\" I asked.\n  \n \n  \"Three or four Earth weeks,\" he replied.\n  \n \n  I sighed wearily. \"Where do we go from here?\"\n  \n \n  \"There are more villages,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never find him.\"\n  \n \n  \"Possibly,\" Joe mused, the smile creeping over his face again.\n  \n \n  \"A wild goose chase. A fool's errand.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better get started,\" Joe said simply.\n  \n \n  I got to my feet and we started the march again. Joe was still fresh, a\nbrilliant contrast to me, weary and dejected. Somehow, I had the same\nfeeling I'd had a long time ago on my sixteenth birthday. One of my\nfriends had taken me all over the city, finally dropping me off at my\nown house where the whole gang was gathered for a surprise party. Joe\nreminded me of that friend.\n  \n \n  \"There's a village ahead,\" he said, and the grin on his face was large\nnow, his eyes shining.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The setting of the story is a small, habitable moon named Sekk, which is characterized by a unique geography centered around a lake and radiating jungle valleys.\n\n1.  **Overall World - Sekk:** The story is set on a small moon named Sekk, which orbits beyond Earth's moon, Luna.

HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city—even a city like this one—in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet—the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis—was—for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not—not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the—well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering—\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out—and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen—\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively—\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw—I thought I\nsaw—something—moving—\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That—\"\n  \n \n  \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\n\n[Chapter: BEACH_SCENE_11]\nPurnie opened his eyes as consciousness returned. Had his friends gone?\n  \n \n  He pulled himself along on his stomach to a position between two rocks,\nwhere he could see without being seen. By the light of the twin moons\nhe saw that they were leaving, marching away in groups of two and\nthree, the weak helping the weaker. As they disappeared around the\ncurving shoreline, the voices of the last two, bringing up the rear far\nbehind the others, fell faintly on his ears over the sound of the surf.\n  \n \n  \"Is it possible that we're all crazy, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's possible, but we're not.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wish I could be sure.\"\n  \n \n  \"See Forbes up ahead there?

Now go on.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_8]\nSometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway—for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped—and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why—er—you see, Joggy—\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n\n[Chapter: Doctor_Universe_6]\nThe following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here\nresembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding\nribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the\nsurface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of\nthe swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive\nmulti-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.\nThe Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his\nhand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in\na matter of seconds.\n  \n \n  At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one\nof the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude\njetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.\n  \n \n  He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and\nunkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was\ndressed in\n   \n   varpa\n   \n  cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his\nhead was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said, shaking my hand. \"Any friend of Miss\nFlowers is a friend of mine.\" He ushered us down the catwalk into his\nhut.\n  \n \n  The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest\ntype of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from\ncivilization entirely.\n  \n \n  Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly.

Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_7]\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n  \n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n  \n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n  \n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n  \n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n  \n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n  \n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n  \n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n  \n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_4]\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n  \n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n  \n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n  \n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n  \n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n  \n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n  \n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n  \n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n  \n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n  \n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n  \n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n  \n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n  \n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n  \n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n  \n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n  \n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n  \n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n  \n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\n\n[Chapter: DUST_UNTO_DUST_1]\nDUST UNTO DUST\n  \n \n  By LYMAN D. HINCKLEY\n  \n \n  It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister\n   \n  city of metal that glittered malignantly before the\n   \n  cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1955.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one\nusually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has\noccurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence\nat the city a quarter-mile away.\n  \n \n  He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the\ntwilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the\nbarren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they\nlanded, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n  \n \n  He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n  \n \n  Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,\nunbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with\na graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n  \n \n  Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the\nstillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight\nsky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the\ncity. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build\na city—even a city like this one—in such surroundings.\n  \n \n  The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting\ngeometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,\nand the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while\nthis planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return\nin their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition\nhad, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return\nflight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only\ncity on the planet—the planet without any life at all, save tiny\nmosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from\nthe city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n  \n \n  \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black\npile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust\ncavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,\nadjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind\nof. I wonder what they were like?\"\n  \n \n  Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n  \n \n  Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the\nsand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining\nmetal band.\n  \n \n  Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n  \n \n  Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell\nthem we're going in.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney nodded.\n  \n \n  After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n  \n \n  Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it\nis—was—for.\"\n  \n \n  \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n  \n \n  \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n  \n \n  The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,\ntheir broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They\npassed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved\ncautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square\nsurrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n  \n \n  Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not—not very big. Is it?\"\n  \n \n  Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the—well, shall we call\nthem, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n  \n \n  Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering—\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n  \n \n  A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved\nslowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out—and the image\nfaded.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.\nThen—\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light\nat all?\"\n  \n \n  \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,\nwe're very likely to find out.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin\nlooked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past\nthat out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat\nlay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,\nfrom here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n  \n \n  He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that\nexplained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was\nsomething familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n  \n \n  \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here.\nWhat's the matter, Wass?\"\n  \n \n  The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\"\nThere was a pause. Then Wass, defensively—\"It's almost as if the city\ndidn't want to be photographed.\"\n  \n \n  Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere\nalong this street.\"\n  \n \n  Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal\nstreet, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n  \n \n  Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was\nalmost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point\nbeing, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and\nsubtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n  \n \n  Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,\nsometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the\nheavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before\nthe thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he\ndecided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n  \n \n  Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up\nMartin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n  \n \n  The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw—I thought I\nsaw—something—moving—\"\n  \n \n  Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the\nother's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,\nman!\"\n  \n \n  Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n  \n \n  \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing\nfrom the other direction.\"\n  \n \n  Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip.

He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_8]\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n  \n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n  \n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n  \n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n  \n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n  \n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n  \n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n  \n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n  \n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n  \n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n  \n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n  \n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n  \n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_5]\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n  \n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n  \n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n  \n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n  \n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n  \n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n  \n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n  \n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n  \n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n  \n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n  \n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n  \n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n  \n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n  \n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n  \n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n  \n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n  \n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n  \n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n  \n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_2]\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n  \n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n  \n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n  \n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n  \n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n  \n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n  \n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n  \n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\n  \n \n \n  Noork\n  \n \n \n  At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n  \n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n  \n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n  \n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n  \n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n  \n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n  \n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n  \n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n  \n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_6]\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n  \n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n  \n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n  \n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n  \n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n  \n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n  \n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n  \n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n  \n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n  \n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n  \n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n  \n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n  \n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n  \n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n  \n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.\n\n**Step 1: Enslavement as a core societal conflict and character motivation.**\nThe theme of enslavement is introduced early in the story as a fundamental moral and political issue on the moon of Sekk. It is the direct cause of the exile of Gurn, a key ally and the brother of the heroine, Sarna. His opposition to the practice of enslaving people from other valleys establishes him as a heroic figure and sets up a clear conflict between those who enslave and those who fight for freedom. This immediately frames the story's central struggle.\n\nSarna explains her brother's stance to Noork, highlighting the injustice of the practice:\n##begin_quote##\n\"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 2: Enslavement as a direct threat and plot driver.**\nThe danger of enslavement is not just an abstract concept; it is a direct and immediate threat to the main characters. Sarna herself is a recent escapee from slavers, and her friends were captured by another group, the \"Misty Ones.\" This personal history provides the immediate motivation for Noork's quest. He is not just exploring a new world; he is actively fighting against a system of capture and subjugation to protect Sarna and rescue others.\n\nSarna recounts her harrowing experience, which directly leads to the next phase of the plot:\n##begin_quote##\n\"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned toward the valley of Grath... And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I alone escaped.\"\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 3: Depicting the reality and psychology of the enslaved.**\nThe story provides a glimpse into the lives of those who are enslaved on the island of Manak. Through the conversation between two slaves, Rold and an older man, the narrative explores their conditions and differing attitudes toward their bondage. The older slave has accepted his fate, finding a twisted form of security in it, while the younger slave, Rold, dreams of escape and freedom. This interaction adds depth to the theme, showing that enslavement is not just a physical state but also a psychological one. Noork's offer of freedom to Rold further solidifies his role as a liberator.\n\nThe older slave offers a bleak perspective on life in bondage, advising the younger man on how to navigate his powerlessness:\n##begin_quote##\n\"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a good woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 4: Thematic parallel to the protagonist's forgotten past.**\nThe theme of freedom versus enslavement on Sekk serves as a powerful parallel to Noork's forgotten identity as Captain Stephen Dietrich, a pilot who was hunting the \"last of the Axis criminals,\" Doctor Karl Von Mark. The Nazi ideology, represented by Von Mark, was built on the principle of enslaving and exterminating entire populations. Therefore, Noork's fight against the slavers on Sekk is an unconscious continuation of his original mission to fight the ultimate enslavers from Earth, linking the moon's local conflict to a much larger, universal struggle for freedom.\n\n##Answer: Enslavement is a central and significant theme that drives the plot, defines the moral conflict, and motivates the protagonist's actions. It is established as the primary"}], "metadata": {"id": "253", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["Enslavement and freedom as themes run throughout the story.  When Noork and Sarna first meet each other in the opening scene, one of the ways they decide to trust one another is because of their mutual relationships with Gurn, a third character.  Gurn has been exiled from the city of Grath because he says that his people should no longer enslave the captured Zurans from other valleys of Sekk.  In the next scene, we learn that Sarna, Gurn's sister, was kidnapped by one group of slavers, escaped them with four others, and only narrowly escaped capture by a second group of slavers, the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull, who captured the other four of her group.  Noork tells her that one day he will visit the island of Misty Ones who took her friends.  At this time, he realizes that Sarna has disappeared, and he is attacked by the Misty Ones, though he is able to fight them off.\n\nDuring Noork's travels to the island of the Misty Ones, we learn his backstory: he is American pilot Stephen Dietrich, and he arrived on the moon of Sekk by following Doctor Karl Von Mark, last of the Nazi criminals at large.  Dietrich's ship had crashed on Sekk, robbing him of his memory.  In the conflict between the Allies and Nazis, we again see the conflict between enslavement and freedom:  the Nazis forced those they considered racially \"impure\" into prison camps where they were either murdered outright or forced to engage in labor under inhumane conditions until they died; the Allied forces were a hope of freedom for these imprisoned, enslaved people.\n\nNoork spies on enslaved men in the fields outside the temple of the Misty Ones and hears them gossiping about Sarna.  The older man suggests that their life is not so bad, but the younger man protests and states that one day he plans to escape.  Noork approaches the younger man to find out where Sarna is being held and promises to take him along when he and Sarna escape.  Noork then fights off multiple guards and a priest in order to free Sarna from the pit where she is held, which is dank and full of rotting grass mats and little light.\n\nWhile the story touches on themes of enslavement and freedom, it does not engage with them fully.  The dungeon where the enslaved young women is held is described in foul terms, but Noork does not seem to free all the young women from their prison.  That may happen as a result of Gurn's final attack on Doctor Von Mark and the Misty Ones, but Noork escapes only with Sarna and Rold.  Rold is unhappy with being enslaved, not because he is being harmed or others are, but because he is not free to mate with attractive young women like Sarna.  While the story should not need to spell out every reason why enslavement is wrong, it takes a very superficial approach to a deeply painful issue.", "Enslavement is a major theme throughout the story. Gurn has been exiled for speaking out against the slavery that his people have inflicted on others, which is how he a Noork find one another. Noork’s travels during the action of the story are undertaken in an effort to save Sarna, who has now been enslaved twice. The person he enlists to help him, Rold, is also a slave. When Doctor Von Mark and the Misty Ones ambush Noork and the doctor recognizes him as Stephen Dietrich, he mentions that the trapper has now become the trapped. A moment later, Gurn and the other warriors free Noork from the doctor’s enslavement. Most of the story involves various people being enslaved or feeling a certain way about enslavement, and the element of Nazism in the story also lends it a broader theme of the enslavement that that regime inflicted and tried to inflict, and the continued possession of the Earth that Von Mark is working toward. \n", "Enslavement seems to be the preferred way to deal with enemies on Sekk, and when Gurn speaks out against enslaving their Zuran captives, the city rulers label him a traitor and exile him from the city. His sister, Tholon, was captured by slavers but managed to escape with four others. However, when they passed near the Lake of Uzdon, the Misty Ones captured her four fellow escapees. And while Tholon is telling her story to Noork, she is kidnapped by the Misty Ones and spirited away to their city of Uzdon. The Misty Ones offer beautiful slave girls chosen by their priests as sacrifices to their god Uzdon, binding them to the altar and removing their hearts while still alive. The Misty Ones also enslave others to be workers. Slaves work in their cultivated fields and gardens, and in the skull, slaves are chained together with heavy chains. ", "Enslavement is an important topic in the story as many of the Zuran peoples are enslaved by various groups. The men of Kanto are enemies of the Vasads and the people of Grath, but the city of Grath also enslaves people. When Gurn speaks out against the practice, he is exiled from Grath and becomes transient with his group of Vasads. When Noork first meets Tholon Sarna, she has fled her initial enslavement, narrowly avoided enslavement by the men of Kanto, and is then captured by the Misty Ones, who also have slaves working on the island of Manak. Noork frees Rold from his enslavement, and enlists his help to prevent Tholon Sarna from becoming a human sacrifice to Uzdon. When the Vasads defeat the Misty Ones and Dr. Von Mark, they are free to live in their own society without the constraints of slavery."]}}

He could see no\nenemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.\n  \n \n  \"You hunt too near the lake,\" called a voice. \"The demons of the water\nwill trap you.\"\n  \n \n  Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled\nwith that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.\n  \n \n  \"It's Noork,\" he grunted. \"Why do I not see you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have stolen the skin of a demon,\" answered the invisible man. \"Go to\nGurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones\ncan be trapped and skinned.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why you want their skins?\" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.\n  \n \n  \"Go to save Gurn's ...\" and here Noork was stumped for words. \"To save\nhis father's woman woman,\" he managed at last. \"Father's woman woman\ncalled Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the\nmarshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the\njungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake\nof Uzdon.\n  \n \n  To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle\nfastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that\nthe giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered\nbrain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men\ncould live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.\n  \n \n  But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths\nof Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the\nother bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the\ngolden-skinned girl, was from another world also.\n  \n \n  The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,\nthe Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land\nof sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the\nsame valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and\nperhaps then he could remember better who he had been.\n  \n \n  So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was\ngone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last\nof the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired\nyoung American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden\nvalley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled\nstructure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the\nsecond of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.\nThe Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this\nlittle blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.\n  \n \n  The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist\npreferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the\nlifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but\nDietrich's spacer had crashed.\n  \n \n  Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads\nhad slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its\ncrystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.\n\n[Chapter: A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_12]\nFeeling depressed and alone, Michaelson found a desert knoll outside\nthe city overlooking the tall spires that shone in the sunlight and\ngleamed in the moonlight. He made a stretcher, rolled the old man's\nbody on to it and dragged it down the long ancient street and up the\nknoll.\n  \n \n  Here he buried him.\n  \n \n  But it seemed a waste of time. Somehow he knew beyond any doubt that\nthe old native and his body were completely disassociated in some sense\nmore complete than death.\n  \n \n  In the days that followed he gave much thought to the \"clock.\" He came\nto the city every day. He spent long hours in the huge square building\nwith the books. He learned the language by sheer bulldog determination.\nThen he searched the books for information about the instrument.\n  \n \n  Finally after many weeks, long after the winds had obliterated all\nevidence of Maota's grave on the knoll, Michaelson made a decision. He\nhad to know if the machine would work for him.\n  \n \n  And so one afternoon when the ancient spires threw long shadows\nover the sand he walked down the long street and entered the old\nman's house. He stood before the instrument, trembling, afraid, but\ndetermined. He pinched his eyes shut tight like a child and pressed the\nbutton.\n  \n \n  The high-pitched whine started.\n  \n \n  Complete, utter silence. Void. Darkness. Awareness and memory, yes;\nnothing else. Then Maota's chuckle came. No sound, an impression only\nlike the voice from the ancient book. Where was he? There was no left\nor right, up or down. Maota was everywhere, nowhere.\n  \n \n  \"Look!\" Maota's thought was directed at him in this place of no\ndirection. \"Think of the city and you will see it.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson did, and he saw the city beyond, as if he were looking\nthrough a window. And yet he was in the city looking at his own body.\n  \n \n  Maota's chuckle again. \"The city will remain as it is. You did not win\nafter all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither did you.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this existence has compensations,\" Maota said. \"You can be\nanywhere, see anywhere on this planet. Even on your Earth.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson felt a great sadness, seeing his body lying across the\nold, home made bed. He looked closer. He sensed a vibration or life\nforce—he didn't stop to define it—in his body. Why was his dead body\ndifferent from Old Maota's? Could it be that there was some thread\nstretching from the reality of his body to his present state?\n  \n \n  \"I don't like your thoughts,\" Maota said. \"No one can go back. I tried.\nI have discussed it with many who are not presently in communication\nwith you. No one can go back.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson decided he try.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_5]\nThe skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the\neye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of\nrock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for\nwindows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at\nthree distinct levels.\n  \n \n  Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps\nthat led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and\npurple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and\nfeathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the\nsquatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs\nfettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing\ngolden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the\nbrilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast\nmen mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.\n  \n \n  Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were\nstationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the\nSkull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another\nof their number.\n  \n \n  He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the\njaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose\nrocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the\ncentral raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly\nworked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish\ncolors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed\ntwo beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the\nwolf-headed shape a female.\n  \n \n  These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura\nworshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!\n  \n \n  Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central\nramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower\npits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two\nupper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty\nOnes climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to\nthe slaves and common citizens of the island.\n  \n \n  As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his\nsensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it\nthere just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight\nof clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two\nshort swords rose to bar his way.\n  \n \n  \"None are to pass save the priests,\" spoke a voice from nowhere\ngruffly. \"The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the\nmost beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the\nsacrifice is chosen.\"\n  \n \n  Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew\nhis sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.\n  \n \n  In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor\nsharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and\nshoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward\nimpetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his\nleft.\n  \n \n  His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony\nstructure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his\nhands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning\ngurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon\nit, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.\n  \n \n  The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the\nshadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.\nFor a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction\nof the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then\nthey jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to\nblood-slippery step.\n  \n \n  The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the\nsame instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man\nwith a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.\nHe sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a\nhalf-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.\n  \n \n  In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging\nout, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle\non the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion\nof the upper temple was muted to a murmur.\n  \n \n  So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that\nhad dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to\nbattle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.\n  \n \n  He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two\nwarriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous\ngurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.\nNoork grinned.\n  \n \n  From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not\nsnore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed\nto a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would\nnot give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the\nroom. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged\ninto the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer\nhere in the artificial light of the flickering torch.\n  \n \n  Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the\nothers. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two\nothers, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.\n  \n \n  The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies\nfrom the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the\nchamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the\nstone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,\nwas held prisoner.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_1]\nRaiders of the Second Moon\n  \n \n  By GENE ELLERMAN\n  \n \n  A strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,\n   \n  and had brought him to this tiny world—to\n   \n  write an end to his first existence.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Summer 1945.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray\nvolcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.\nBut of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by\nLuna's bulk, we know little.\n  \n \n  Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in\ndiameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its\nmeaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,\nlife that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval\nlake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the\nstarry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.\n  \n \n  In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called\nNoork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the\ntrail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned\ngirl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a\nsheathed dagger.\n  \n \n  Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine\ncontours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the\ninsignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.\nNot forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged\ncliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,\nand the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had\nconfirmed that belief.\n  \n \n  For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of\nthe cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour\nthe great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death\nof the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the\nwords that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated\nthem aloud.\n  \n \n  \"New York,\" he said, \"good ol' New York.\"\n  \n \n  The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going\nback to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow\nand stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle\ngiant. Noork grinned.\n  \n \n  \"Tako, woman,\" he greeted her.\n  \n \n  \"Tako,\" she replied fearfully. \"Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you\nhunter or escaped slave?\"\n  \n \n  \"A friend,\" said Noork simply. \"It was I who killed the spotted\n   \n   narl\n   \n  last night when it attacked you.\"\n  \n \n  Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never\nfar from the hilt of her hunting dagger.\n  \n \n  Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder\nof limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.\n  \n \n  \"Your hair is the color of the sun!\" she said. \"Your garb is Vasad, yet\nyou speak the language of the true men.\" Her violet oddly slanting eyes\nopened yet wider. \"Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am Noork,\" the man told her. \"For many days have I dwelt among the\nwild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for\nmy friend.\"\n  \n \n  The girl impulsively took a step nearer. \"Gurn!\" she cried. \"Is he tall\nand strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with\nhuman hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?\"\n  \n \n  \"That is Gurn,\" admitted Noork shortly. \"He is also an exile from the\nwalled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told\nme the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Sarna. \"My brother said that we should no longer\nmake slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.\"\n  \n \n  Noork smiled. \"I am glad he is your brother,\" he said simply.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_4]\nNoork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight\nshore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could\nnot remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly\nblade well.\n  \n \n  After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding\ncushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the\nroofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's\nedge.\n  \n \n  Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a\nsmothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to\nthe wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal\nbranch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of\na braided leather rope to the ground beyond.\n  \n \n  He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps\nhalf a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of\nbonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!\n  \n \n  Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty\nOne he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a\ncomfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.\n  \n \n  \"The new slave,\" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, \"is the\ndaughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.\"\n  \n \n  Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's\nname was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty\nOnes and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together\nbeneath his tree.\n  \n \n  \"That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,\" the slighter of the\ntwo slaves, his hair almost white, said. \"If she be chosen for the\nsacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than\nanother's.\"\n  \n \n  \"But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,\" complained the\nyounger slave, \"that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful\nwoman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.\"\n  \n \n  The old man chuckled dryly. \"If your wife be plain,\" he said, \"neither\nmaster nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a\ngood woman—and ugly, my son.\"\n  \n \n  \"Some night,\" snarled the slave, \"I'm going over the wall. Even the\nMisty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence,\" hissed the white-haired man. \"Such talk is madness. We are\nsafe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island\nof Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,\nare not unkind.\n  \n \n  \"Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,\" he finished, \"and I will\ncomplete my checking of the gardens.\"\n  \n \n  Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the\ntree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,\nand he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles\nthat his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made\nclear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Continue to work,\" he said to the young man. \"Do not be too surprised\nat what I am about to tell you, Rold.\" He paused and watched the golden\nman's rather stupid face intently.\n  \n \n  \"I am not a Misty One,\" Noork said. \"I killed the owner of this strange\ngarment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the\ngirl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.\"\n  \n \n  Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.\n\"The Misty Ones, then,\" he said slowly, \"are not immortal demons!\" He\nnodded his long-haired head. \"They are but men. They too can die.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you will help me, Rold,\" said Noork, \"to rescue the girl and escape\nfrom the island I will take you along.\"\n  \n \n  Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his\npeople were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would\nwelcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from\nthe enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for\nhelping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.\n  \n \n  \"I will help you, stranger,\" he agreed.\n  \n \n  \"Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where\nTholon Sarna is held.\"\n  \n \n  The slave's fingers flew. \"All the young female slaves are caged\ntogether in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly\noverhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to\nmighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the\nnext day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great\nUzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast.\" The slave's\nmismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.\n  \n \n  \"Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female\nslaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple\npits.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is enough,\" said Noork. \"I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared\nto join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.\"\n  \n \n  \"If you are captured,\" cried Rold nervously, \"you will not tell them I\ntalked with you?\"\n  \n \n  Noork laughed. \"You never saw me,\" he told the slave.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_8]\nA fat, square-jawed face, harsh lines paralleling the ugly blob of a\nnose, showed through the opened robe of the leader. The face was that\nof Doctor Von Mark the treacherous Nazi scientist that Stephen Dietrich\nhad trailed across space to Sekk! But Noork knew nothing of that chase.\nThe man's face seemed familiar, and hateful, but that was all he\nremembered.\n  \n \n  \"I see you have come from the island,\" said the Doctor. \"Perhaps you\ncan tell me the secret of this invisible material I wear. With the\nsecret of invisibility I, Karl Von Mark, can again conquer Earth and\nmake the Fatherland invincible.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do not understand too well,\" said Noork hesitantly. \"Are we enemies?\nThere is so much I have forgotten.\" He regarded the brutal face\nthoughtfully.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you know from what valley the great bird brought me,\" he said.\n\"Or perhaps the other bird brought you here.\"\n  \n \n  Von Mark's blue eyes widened and then he roared with a great noise\nthat was intended to be mirth. His foot slammed harder into Noork's\ndefenseless ribs.\n  \n \n  \"Perhaps you have forgotten, swine of an American,\" he roared suddenly,\nand in his hand was an ugly looking automatic. He flung back his robe\nand Noork saw the dress uniform of a general. \"Perhaps,\" the scientist\nrepeated, \"but I will take no chances. The amnesia is often but a\npretense.\"\n  \n \n  His lip curled. \"This is something for you to remember, Captain\nDietrich,\" he said as the ugly black muzzle of the gun centered on\nNoork's bronzed chest.\n  \n \n  And then Doctor Von Mark cursed as the gun dropped from his nerveless\nfingers and his hands clawed weakly at the arrow buried in his wide\nbelly. He stumbled backward.\n  \n \n  Arrows rained from the mistiness that had closed in about Von Mark and\nhis men. The men from Wari, their faces unshielded, fell like flies.\nIn a moment those yet alive had taken to their heels, and Noork felt\ninvisible fingers tearing at the nets that bound him.\n  \n \n  As he rose to his feet the robed figure let its misty covering drop\naside. A handsome golden-skinned warrior stood revealed.\n  \n \n  \"Gurn!\" cried Noork.\n  \n \n  A glad cry came from the throat of Tholon Sarna as she saw her brother.\nAnd then she crept closer to Noork's side as the invisible mantles\nof Gurn's loyal Vasads opened to reveal the hairy beast men they\nconcealed. Rold whimpered fearfully.\n  \n \n  \"The message that Ud carried to me was good,\" laughed Gurn. \"The Misty\nOnes skin easily. We were trapping the Misty Ones as they came across\nthe lake,\" he looked at the dying Von Mark, \"as were these others. Soon\nwe would have come to your rescue, Noork, my friend.\"\n  \n \n  \"Lucky I escaped first,\" Noork told him. \"The priests of Uzdon would\nhave trapped you. To them the Misty Ones are visible.\"\n  \n \n  He picked up the fallen vision shield that lay beside their feet. His\nchest expanded proudly.\n  \n \n  \"No longer,\" he told Gurn, \"am I a man without a name. I am Captain\nDietrich from a distant valley called America. I was hunting this evil\nman when my bird died.\"\n  \n \n  He smiled and his brown arm tightened around Sarna's golden body. \"The\nevil man is dead. My native valley is safe. Now I can live in peace\nwith you, Gurn, and with your sister, here in the jungle.\"\n  \n \n  \"It is good, Noork,\" smiled Tholon Sarna.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_2]\nThe girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded\ninto her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.\n  \n \n  \"Brown-skinned one!\" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little\nsandalled foot. \"I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will\nlisten to it no more.\"\n  \n \n  But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned\ngiant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....\n  \n \n  The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along\nthe game-trail. \"When my captors were but one day's march from their\nfoul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose\nfertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.\n  \n \n  \"And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned\ntoward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where\nour enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of\nUzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I\nalone escaped.\"\n  \n \n  Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath\nat his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper\nof flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the\nmysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.\n  \n \n  \"Some day,\" he said reflectively, \"I am going to visit the island of\nthe unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I\nhave taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to\nyour city of Grath....\" He smiled.\n  \n \n  The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer\nspeaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He\nturned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive\nreflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of\nthe jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,\nnumbing it so he felt nothing for some time.\n  \n \n  One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,\nNoork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once\nthere, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down\nat the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.\n  \n \n \n  Noork\n  \n \n \n  At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no\nstir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse\nof blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all\ntoo well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the\nLake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied\nwith the mud of the trail.\n  \n \n  Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain\nwas growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He\nclimbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe\nfruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of\nthe great limb and filled his arms with fruit.\n  \n \n  A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread\nand grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork\nfound that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose\narms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of\nsuperstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads\nvanished.\n  \n \n  These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They\nwere not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He\nstrung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,\nand rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.\n  \n \n  And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the\njungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of\nthis Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.\n  \n \n  A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the\nfallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath\nthem. His lip curled at what he saw.\n  \n \n  The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as\nthat of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating\nin a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face\nwas made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular\ndesign. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons\nwere two long knives and a club.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" said Noork, \"the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And\nthe Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like\nthis.\"\n  \n \n  Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down\nthe game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its\nunseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the\nstains from the dead man's foggy robe.\n  \n \n  The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the\ndrying fabric of the mantle and donned it.\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_6]\nThe steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water\ndotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two\nsputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was\nwalled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and\ntoward this Noork made his way.\n  \n \n  He stood beside the door. \"Sarna,\" he called softly, \"Tholon Sarna.\"\n  \n \n  There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland\nby the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the\nrotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple\nskirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the\nmark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's\nvalleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and\nconfined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope\nhide.\n  \n \n  One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the\nmetal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined\nthe outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive\ntimber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a\nprepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.\n  \n \n  \"It is Noork,\" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go\nwide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.\n  \n \n  \"The priest,\" hissed the girl.\n  \n \n  Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the\nspike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he\nfaced the burly priest of the Skull.\n  \n \n  Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield\nof transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as\nhe saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he said, \"to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do\nnot trust your guards, then.\"\n  \n \n  The priest laughed. \"We also have robes of invisibility,\" he said, \"and\nthe sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes.\" He snarled suddenly at the\nsilent figure of the white man. \"Down on your knees, guard, and show me\nyour face before I kill you!\"\n  \n \n  Noork raised his sword. \"Take my hood off if you dare, priest,\" he\noffered.\n  \n \n  The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of\nhis sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the\nvelvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from\nthe priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that\ndrew blood from left shoulder to elbow.\n  \n \n  The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He\nwas a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white\nman's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so\nhis robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed\nbody. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the\nslightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.\n  \n \n  The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,\nand the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch\nso well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his\nmouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful\nwhether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the\nmain temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his\nenemy.\n  \n \n  Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the\nsword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork\nleaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a\nmoment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.\n  \n \n  Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.\nHurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and\nslipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.\n  \n \n  \"Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?\" Noork asked tensely.\n  \n \n  \"No,\" came the girl's low voice, \"I do not think so. I did not know\nthat this priest was here until he appeared behind you.\" A slow smile\ncrossed Noork's hidden features. \"His robe must be close by,\" he told\nthe girl. \"He must have been stationed here because the priests feared\nthe guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched\nthe soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway\nentrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the\npriest \"Uzdon's window\" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the\nnew robe.\n  \n \n  \"My own robe is slit in a dozen places,\" he explained to the girl's\ncurious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision\nslot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the\ngirl's hand.\n  \n \n  \"Come,\" he said, \"let us escape over the wall before the alarm is\ngiven.\"\n\n[Chapter: Raiders_of_the_Second_Moon_7]\nWithout incident they reached the field where Rold toiled among the\nrows of vegetables. Another slave was working in a nearby field,\nhis crude wooden plow pulled by two sweating Vasads, but he was not\nwatching when Rold abruptly faded from view.\n  \n \n  Noork was sweating with the weight of two cloaks and the airlessness of\nthe vision shield as they crossed the field toward his rope, but he had\nno wish to discard them yet. The tinted shield had revealed that dozens\nof the Misty Ones were stationed about the wall to guard against the\nescape of the slaves.\n  \n \n  They came to the wall and to Noork's great joy found the rope hanging\nas he had left it. He climbed the wall first and then with Rold helping\nfrom below, drew Sarna to his side. A moment later saw the three of\nthem climbing along the limb to the bole of the tree and so to the\njungle matted ground outside the wall.\n  \n \n  \"Will we hide here in the trees until night?\" asked the girl's full\nvoice.\n  \n \n  Noork held aside a mossy creeper until the girl had passed. \"I think\nnot,\" he said. \"The Misty Ones are continually passing from the island\nto the shore. We are Misty Ones to any that watch from the wall. So we\nwill paddle boldly across the water.\"\n  \n \n  \"That is good,\" agreed the slave, \"unless they see us put out from the\nshore. Their two landing stages are further along the beach, opposite\nthe Temple of Uzdon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we must hug to the shore until we pass the tip of the island,\"\nsaid Noork thoughtfully. \"In that way even if they detect us we will\nhave put a safe distance between us.\"\n  \n \n  Shortly after midday Noork felt the oozy slime of the marshy lowlands\nof the mainland beneath his paddle and the dugout ran ashore in the\ngrassy inlet for which they had been heading. His palms were blistered\nand the heavy robes he yet wore were soaked with sweat.\n  \n \n  \"Once we reach the jungle,\" he told the girl, \"off come these robes. I\nam broiled alive.\"\n  \n \n  Suddenly Noork froze in his tracks. He thrust the girl behind him.\n\"Misty Ones!\" he hissed to Rold. \"They crouch among the reeds. They\ncarry nets and clubs to trap us.\"\n  \n \n  Rold turned back toward the boat with Noork and Sarna close at his\nheels. But the Misty Ones were upon them and by sheer numbers they bore\nthem to the ground. Noork's mightier muscles smashed more than one\nhooded face but in the end he too lay smothered beneath the nets and\nbodies of the enemy.\n  \n \n  A misty shape came to stand beside these three new captives as they\nwere stripped of their robes. His foot nudged at Noork's head curiously\nand a guttural voice commanded the shield be removed. Then his voice\nchanged—thickened—as he saw the features of Noork.\n  \n \n  \"So,\" he barked in a tongue that should have been strange to Noork but\nwas not, \"it is the trapper's turn to be trapped, eh Captain Dietrich?\"\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.

Noork, however, is able to catch a glimpse of the bottom of one of their feet from his vantage point high in a tree and begins to pelt the area where he believes they are with fruit.  After this, he can see their outlines and that they are wearing robes with hoods, and he ceases to be afraid and attacks with arrows, killing one of the Misty Ones.  He disrobes this man, who is described as heavily scarred on his face, having a low forehead, with more hair on his body and less golden skin than other men of Zuran.  Once Noork is sure that the Misty Ones are not supernatural, he decides to pursue them in an attempt to rescue Sarna, sister of his friend Gurn, who has been kidnapped by them.\n\nNoork spreads the word to his friend Ud that the Misty Ones are not demons and can be trapped and skinned and lets Ud know of his rescue mission for Sarna.  He also tells Rold, an enslaved man on the island of the Misty Ones and the priests of Uzdon (the god who demands sacrifice of young women).  Rold decides he will help Noork with his rescue mission in exchange for Noork's promise to rescue him as well--realizing that he is imprisoned by men and not demons has allowed him to dream that he can kill his captors and be free.\n\nWhen Noork fights a priest of Uzdon in order to free Sarna, he learns that the priests not only have the robes of concealment the Misty Ones have, they also have transparent masks that allow them to see through that concealment.  It allows him to anticipate their ambush at the end of the story, though not quite soon enough to stop it.  Gurn, though, has received his message and acted on it.  He has been capturing and \"skinning\" Misty Ones who have crossed the lake and he and his warriors ambush the Misty Ones and priests in return, freeing Noork and his friends.  With the realization that the Misty Ones are men with special cloaks rather than demons with supernatural powers, their mystique evaporates and everyone they have terrorized is willing to attack them.  Characters unwilling to battle demons are unafraid to attack men.", "The Misty Ones are significant for several reasons. They are creatures that come from the island in the lake of Uzdon, and they look like mist and are therefore nearly invisible to most (other than the priests). They are thought to be demons and perhaps invincible, but Noork discovers otherwise when he gets close enough to see that they look like him. He passes a message along to Gurn that they can be trapped and skinned. Noork’s discovery of this allows him to rescue Sarna and allows Gurn and the other warriors to rescue them from Doctor Von Mark. \n", "The Misty Ones are mysterious beings who are invisible and cause problems for others. With so little is known about them other than their devious acts, they are considered demons. They live on an island in the Lake of Uzdon and have a giant skull known as the Temple of the Skull that represents their god, Uzdon, to whom they over living female sacrifices. The Misty Ones wear cloaks that make them invisible, and until Noork shoots and kills one with an arrow, no one knows that they are flesh and bone beings underneath their robes. Noork discovers they look very much like he does but with a low, sloping forehead and more body hair. When the Misty Ones kidnap Tholon, Noork notices he can see a foot of one of them because it was covered with mud. He throws overripe fruit at the group, and the fruit stains their cloaks, enabling Noork to see them. The Misty Ones capture girls to be slave sacrifices to their god, but they also capture men who work for them in their fields and gardens and others who move through the skull all chained together. They are led by priests who also wear cloaks that make them invisible and colorful feathers along with a face shield that enables them to see the other Misty Ones in their cloaks. Once Noork discovers that the Misty Ones are like everyone else, the Misty Ones lose the advantage of the fear they engender in others and risk death at their hands.\n", "The Misty Ones are a group of people who mostly dwell on the island of Manak. They control a group of slaves on the island and manage the sacrificial rituals for the gods they worship, Uzdon and Lornu. To complete these sacrifices, they habitually capture and imprison young women from around the land of Zura, and they choose the youngest and most beautiful to sacrifice. The Misty Ones inspire fear in the hearts of the Vasads and other peoples of Zura due to their mysterious nature and their ability to move about invisibly. However, their weakness is revealed when Noork discovers they are not completely invisible after all, and their “skin” (an invisibility robe) can be easily removed. Noork has his friend Ud pass this message along to Gurn and his Vasads to encourage them to no longer fear the Misty Ones. This tactic works, and the Vasads show up just in time to save the day."]}}

The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next—for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space—all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once—then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another.

We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n  \n \n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n  \n \n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n  \n \n  \"It's come—for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate.

Take-off in five\nminutes.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  The man ahead swore and flicked up an arm. \"Red,\" he groaned. \"By the\ninfinite galaxies, this is the last straw!\" He charged away, knocking\nShano aside as he passed.\n  \n \n \n   Red signal.\n   \n  In bewildered anxiety Shano lifted the goggles from his\neyes and stared into the sudden blackness. The red signal. Danger out\nthere. Passengers advised to ground themselves, or travel at their own\nrisk.\n  \n \n  He felt the passengers bump and fumble past him, grumbling vexatiously.\n  \n \n  A hot dread assailed him, and he coughed, plucking at his chest.\nPlucking at an urgency there.\n  \n \n  Dropping the goggles to his rheumy eyes, he saw that the passenger line\nhad dissolved. He moved, shuffling, to the gate, thrust his ticket into\nthe scanner slot, and pushed through the turnstile when it clicked.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Flight twenty-one, now arriving from Venus\n   \n  ,\" the loud-speaker said\nmonotonously. Shano glanced briefly upward and saw the gleaming belly\nof twenty-one sinking into the spaceport cone of light.\n  \n \n  He clawed his way up the gangway and thrust out his ticket to the\nlieutenant standing alone at the air lock. The lieutenant, a sullen,\nchunky man with a queer nick in his jawbone, refused the ticket.\n\"Haven't you heard, mister? Red signal. Go on back.\"\n  \n \n  Shano coughed, and peered through the lenses of his goggles. \"Please,\"\nhe said. \"Want to go home. I've a right.\" The nicked jaw stirred faint\nmemories within his glazed mind.\n  \n \n  The lieutenant punched his ticket. \"It's your funeral, old man.\"\n  \n \n  The loud-speaker blared. \"\n   \n   Stardust, taking off in thirty seconds. The\nsignal is red. Stardust, taking—\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  With the words dinning in his ears, Shano stepped into the air lock.\nThe officer followed, spun wheels, and the lock closed. The outside was\nshut off.\n  \n \n  Lifting goggles they entered the hull, through a series of two more\nlocks, closing each behind them.\n  \n \n  \"We're afloat,\" the officer said. \"We've taken off.\" A fleck of light\ndanced far back in his eye. Shano felt the pressure of acceleration\ngradually increasing, increasing, and hurried in.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_3]\nSeven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  —Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night—for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time—Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk—the Ghost will come—for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_2]\nThe weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n  \n \n  When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n  \n \n  Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n  \n \n  Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n  \n \n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n  \n \n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n  \n \n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n  \n \n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n  \n \n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n  \n \n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n   \n   It's come—for me!\n   \n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas—ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n  \n \n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n  \n \n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n  \n \n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_4]\nWillard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND—ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_5]\nHe woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the\npassing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so\nmuch of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the\npoint of gibbering insanity.\n  \n \n  He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he\nnever remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to\nremove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n  \n \n  During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n  \n \n  Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n  \n \n  And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space.

Although the ship can still carry out functions to support life, it is not navigable. After Willard helps Dobbin look at the stars one more time, Dobbin cries out that it’s true—when an astronaut is dying, the Ghost Ship comes for him. \n\nWillard recycles Dobbin’s body but feels regretful about it. He longs to see the Earth again and walk on it, but he knows this will never happen and feels intensely lonely. After two years, a strange thing happens. Willard is looking at the stars, and it seems that they are winking at him. Something seems to be moving toward him, and it turns out to be an ancient ship. Willard’s gauges do not register the ship’s presence although he sees it with his own eyes, and Willard realizes that it is the Ghost Ship coming for him. Strangely enough, however, the ship turns away and moves away from him.\n\nSeven years later, a newspaper on Earth publishes a story that Willard’s son, J.

John Willard is taking care of his co-pilot and best friend, Larry Dobbin as he dies. A meteor struck their rocket ship, the Mary Lou, and damaged both her and Dobbin. As Dobbin dies, Willard gently takes care of him and lifts him up to the port so he can see the stars one last time. Just before he passes, Dobbin cries out and says he saw the infamous ghost ship. It steals dying spacemen who have no hope of returning to Earth, cursing them to spend the rest of their lives as ghosts in space. \nAfter Dobbin passes, Willard watches over him for two days before removing his body and turning it into energy for the useless engine in the Mary Lou. Although the ship is livable, it is not flyable. Taking careful diligence to check every part of the ship, Willard manages to keep the Mary Lou from completely shutting down. He transforms waste into food and learns to survive. \nTwo years of great loneliness and despair pass. As Willard looks out the port, he sees blinking stars. Excited, he investigates and realizes that it was an old-fashioned spaceship from decades ago. He soon sees that half of it is invisible, hence the blinking star phenomenon. As the ship gets closer, his sensors remain quiet. Putting it all together, he concludes that this is the Ghost Ship, but pushes the thought away, claiming it’s impossible. Slowly, the ship turns around and travels away from him. \nFlash forward seven more years and a newspaper published a story about Willard and Dobbin on Earth. Sadly, he would never get to see it. Willard’s son was about to create his own ship called Mary Lou II to honor his father. Willard spends his years alone trying to survive and also trying to fight off his memories of home, as they torture him. He kept up with the days and nights of Earth for many years and made his bed. But the memories of his old friends, the cities he lived in, and the crunch of snow beneath his feet drove him mad. Quickly, he lost track of the days. Another ship came and went, torturing him with hope yet again. \nAlmost twenty years passed and he grew more anguished every day. A ship came toward him and asked if he wanted to board, seeing as his ship was unlivable. Grateful he had checked the space suit beforehand, Willard traveled to the other ship and quickly fell into a deep sleep, exhausted by his years of solitude. After being drugged and evaded, Willard finally gets to speak to the captain of the ship on the third week who reveals that this is the Ghost Ship. Willard was only able to perceive the Ghost Ship because he and the Mary Lou were already ghosts, faded to the human eye. They are only shells on the Ghost Ship, and Willard is doomed to join them forever.

Eventually, Dobbin dies, and he claims to see the fabled \"Ghost Ship\" seconds before his passing. After Dobbin's death, Willard manages to stay alive thanks to the machines that could convert waste into food and air. Willard spends two years alone, lost in hopeless thought and agony. Eventually, he sees a blinking shape in the distance, which he soon determines is an old-fashioned rocket ship. However, his instruments indicate there is no ship despite what he sees. Willard oscillates between doubting his own vision and believing there must be a scientific explanation for it. As he struggles with these thoughts, the ship leaves, and Willard spends seven years alone. Meanwhile, back on Earth, a newspaper from his hometown of Arden publishes an obituary of Willard and Dobbin indicating Willard’s son’s intention to build a “Mary Lou II.” Willard recalls memories with his wife and co-workers and the feeling of walking around Arden. He thinks about the legend of the Ghost Ship, which is said to come for the spacemen who die in space alone. A few years pass, and Willard sees the Ghost Ship pass close to him and turn away again, appearing to taunt him. He begins to lose track of time and guesses that as many as twenty years pass; he spends his days going through the motions of managing the ship as he feels himself aging physically. Then, he sees a ship approach, and this time it is a real ship. The ship sends out a rescue calls and retrieves Willard from the “Mary Lou.” Willard spends the next few days reacquainting himself with human interaction and struggling with the horrible memories of his decades in solitude. Then, he starts to realize something is off about the crew of the ship that rescued him. They will not engage him in any conversation other than the operations of the ship. When Willard meets the captain later, he reveals he actually is on the Ghost Ship after all. It only appeared solid to Willard the more the “Mary Lou” lost its mass and energy and itself became a kind of “ghost ship” through its aimless wandering through space. Willard realizes he is dead and will never again return to Earth. ", "John Willard and Larry Dobbin are the lone space explorers aboard the Mary Lou, a ship that can’t move due to meteor damage. As the story begins, WIllard tries to comfort Dobbin as Dobbin dies. Before passing away, Dobbin sees what he believes to be “The Ghost Ship”, a fabled ship that comes for dying spacemen. Willard believes Ghost Ships are just fairy tales and that Dobbin was delirious. \n\nTwo years later, Willard sees what looks like a partially invisible rocket ship, though his ship’s control board shows no sign of anything. As the ship turns away and disappears, Willard wonders if he imagined it or if it could be The Ghost Ship, but decides that is impossible. \n\nSeven more years go by, and we read a small article from Willard and Dobbin’s hometown newspaper (that we are told Willard will never see), about the thirteenth anniversary of Willard and Dobbin embarking on their mission, how they have never been heard from again, and how Willard’s son is having a large spaceship manufactured in his father’s honor. \n\nBack on the Mary Lou, Willard can’t help but dream of his Earth days each night. He grows more and more despondent and thinks about Ghost Ships. He stops looking out the window, and isn’t sure if fifteen or twenty years have passed. He wonders if he has gone mad when he sees a ship coming. Everything changes when he realizes that it’s a real ship that taps out a real message on his space-telegrapher.\n\nThe other ship invites him to come aboard and he gratefully accepts, boarding it and immediately falling asleep. Over the next few weeks he drifts in and out of consciousness, knowing that he must be being drugged but also realizing it would be difficult for him to acclimate to being around others so soon. His memories start to come back and his mind starts to clear, and he notices that none of the men caring for him want to give him any information or answer his questions. \n\nAfter Willard awakens fully, one of the men says he’ll get the captain, who wanted to see Willard when he came to. The captain comes to see him, and Willard notices that he is very old. He tells the captain that he can’t wait to get to Earth and asks when they’ll go. The captain explains that after floating around in space for as long as they and Willard have, things and people lose their mass and energy. Willard hadn’t yet lost his twenty years ago, which is why their ship didn’t look fully formed to him then. Now that he has, he is just a shell like them and can see them fully. \n\nAs Willard puts the pieces together, the captain explains that they can’t go to Earth because they would pass right through it. Willard realizes that this is, in fact, a Ghost Ship, and that they are the ghosts, and the captain confirms this. \n"]}}

A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night—for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time—Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk—the Ghost will come—for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_1]\nGALACTIC GHOST\n  \n \n  By WALTER KUBILIUS\n  \n \n  The Flying Dutchman of space was a harbinger\n   \n  of death. But Willard wasn't superstitions.\n   \n  He had seen the phantom—and lived.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The only friend in space Willard had ever known was dying. Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n  \n \n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n  \n \n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n  \n \n  \"It's come—for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n\n[Chapter: THE_GIANTS_RETURN_5]\nLlud sighed. He still couldn't say just why he had given the order to\nturn back. The stars had claimed his heart—but he was still a part of\nEarth, and not even nine hundred years of space and time had been able\nto alter that.\n  \n \n  He wondered if there would still be a quiet stream and a green\nshady place beside it where a death-weary man, relieved at last of\nresponsibility, could rest and dream no more.... Those things went\non, if men didn't change them. And a pine forest where he and young\nKnof could go camping, and lie on their backs at night and gaze at the\nglittering constellations, far away, out of reach.... He wasn't sure he\nwould want to do that, though.\n  \n \n  Suddenly a faint cushioned jar went through the great ship; it seemed\nto falter one moment in flight.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_2]\nThe weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n  \n \n  When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n  \n \n  Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n  \n \n  Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n  \n \n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n  \n \n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n  \n \n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n  \n \n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n  \n \n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n  \n \n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n   \n   It's come—for me!\n   \n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas—ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n  \n \n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n  \n \n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n  \n \n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_6]\nHe awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next—for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space—all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once—then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real—to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears—to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_4]\nWillard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND—ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_5]\nHe woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the\npassing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so\nmuch of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the\npoint of gibbering insanity.\n  \n \n  He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he\nnever remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to\nremove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n  \n \n  During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n  \n \n  Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n  \n \n  And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the\nyears he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .

Willard is also pained by his memories of Earth and what he has lost and will never have again. Alone in space, Willard considers his memories the only things of value to him. Because his memories cause him so much pain, Willard tries to ignore them or remove them, but they return in his dreams. His memories in his dreams are full of sensory details and other details that he did not notice when he was on Earth. However, when Willard is drugged and sleeping on the Ghost Ship, his dreams are of memories from the years he spent on the Mary Lou, and his dreams about people that he knew are unpleasant. Willard believes that if he could walk on Earth one more time, he would die a happy man.", "Memories are both joys for Willard as well as his greatest anguish. The memories of his time on Earth, the sound of his friend’s voices, the feel of the ground beneath his feet, and even the sounds of the buildings and the city torture him since it gives him something to hope for. \nHe is not able to let go of his life because he longs to survive and live out the rest of his days on Earth.

Even as the “Mary Lou” slowly begins to lose its energy and shape and become a “ghost ship”, Willard is not aware that this process is even happening because his memories keep him grounded in a kind of reality. In this reality, his memories keep Willard alive because Willard believes he is alive and that a real ship has come to save him.

The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!\"\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, Dobbin,\" Willard demanded, \"What do you see? What is\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded\nspace.\n  \n \n  \"The Ghost Ship!\"\n  \n \n  Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in\nwhispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.\nBut he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of\nDobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up\nin this time of delirium.\n  \n \n  \"There's nothing there,\" he said firmly.\n  \n \n  \"It's come—for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward\nWillard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His\nmouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n\n[Chapter: Stalemate_In_Space_1]\n*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK STALEMATE IN SPACE ***\n  \n  Stalemate In Space\n  \n \n  By CHARLES L.

The top of the\ncubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that a\nrib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way of\nknowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it.\nFor a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Die now—die now—die now\n   \n  —\"\n  \n \n  The votron had awakened her with its heart-breaking code message, and\nit was her duty to carry out its command. Nine years after the great\nbattle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in this\ntiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certain\nher countrymen had either definitely won—or lost.\n  \n \n  The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She had\nexpected nothing else.\n  \n \n  She had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that would\nset in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe,\nand the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and nameless\ngrave of space.\n  \n \n  But life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandon\nimmediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrily\nover the memories of her past.\n  \n \n  For twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched\n   \n   The Defender\n   \n  grow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sized\nbattle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythian\nglobe,\n   \n   The Invader\n   \n  , sprang out of black space to enslave the budding\nTerran Confederacy,\n   \n   The Defender\n   \n  was unfinished, half-equipped, and\nundermanned.\n  \n \n  The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.\n  \n \n \n   The Defender\n   \n  , commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled\nitself from its orbit around Procyon and met\n   \n   The Invader\n   \n  with giant\nfission torpedoes.\n  \n \n  And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser Magellanic\nCloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-men\npoured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken\n   \n   Defender\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unreal\nand terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken the\nScythians nine years to conquer\n   \n   The Defender's\n   \n  outer shell. Then had\ncome that final interview with her father.\n  \n \n  \"In half an hour our last space port will be captured,\" he had\ntelepathed curtly. \"Only one more messenger ship can leave\n   \n   The\nDefender\n   \n  . Be on it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No. I shall die here.\"\n  \n \n  His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. \"Then\ndie usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that will\ndestroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they are\nsuccessful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of the\nbattle.\"\n  \n \n  \"There's an off-chance you may survive,\" countered a mentor. \"We're\nalso working on a means for your escape—not only because you are\nGordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will prevent\nradio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape with\nour secret if and when our experiments prove successful.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you must expect to die,\" her father had warned with gentle\nfinality.\n  \n \n  She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenched\nherself back to the present.\n  \n \n  That time had come.\n  \n \n  With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay on\nthe floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest with\nboth hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedo\nfissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of the\nship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezing\nwould she die.\n  \n \n  She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped in\ndismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bonds\nand was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubicle\nhad been terrific.\n  \n \n  With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examined\nthe interior of the box.\n  \n \n  It was a shattered ruin.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_3]\nSeven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  —Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night—for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time—Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk—the Ghost will come—for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_6]\nHe awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next—for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space—all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once—then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real—to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears—to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_4]\nWillard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND—ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_5]\nHe woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the\npassing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so\nmuch of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the\npoint of gibbering insanity.\n  \n \n  He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he\nnever remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to\nremove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n  \n \n  During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n  \n \n  Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n  \n \n  And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the\nyears he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . His dreams were vivid, peopled with men and women he had\nonce known, and were horrible with the fantasies of terror that years\nof solitary brooding had implanted deep in his mind.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_2]\nThe weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n  \n \n  When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n  \n \n  Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n  \n \n  Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n  \n \n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n  \n \n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n  \n \n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n  \n \n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n  \n \n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n  \n \n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n   \n   It's come—for me!\n   \n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas—ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n  \n \n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n  \n \n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n  \n \n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.

Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n  \n \n  When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n  \n \n  Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n  \n \n  Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n  \n \n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n  \n \n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n  \n \n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n  \n \n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n  \n \n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n  \n \n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n   \n   It's come—for me!\n   \n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas—ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n  \n \n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n  \n \n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n  \n \n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_6]\nHe awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next—for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space—all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once—then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real—to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears—to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n\n[Chapter: CAPTAIN_MIDAS_1]\nCAPTAIN MIDAS\n  \n \n  By ALFRED COPPEL, JR.\n  \n \n  The captain of the Martian Maid stared avidly at\n   \n  the torn derelict floating against the velvet void.\n   \n  Here was treasure beyond his wildest dreams!

A magic word, even today, isn't it? Lust and gold ... they go\nhand in hand. Like the horsemen of the Apocalypse. And, of course,\nthere's another word needed to make up the trilogy. You don't get\nany thing for nothing. So add this: Cost. Or you might call it pain,\nsorrow, agony. Call it what you like. It's what you pay for great\ntreasure....\n  \n \n  These things were true when fabled Jason sailed the Argo beyond Colchis\nseeking the Fleece. They were true when men sailed the southern oceans\nin wooden ships. And the conquest of space hasn't changed us a bit.\nWe're still a greedy lot....\n  \n \n  I'm a queer one to be saying these things, but then, who has more\nright? Look at me. My hair is gray and my face ... my face is a mask.\nThe flesh hangs on my bones like a yellow cloth on a rickety frame. I\nam old, old. And I wait here on my hospital cot—wait for the weight of\nyears I never lived to drag me under and let me forget the awful things\nmy eyes have seen.\n  \n \n  I'm poor, too, or else I wouldn't be here in this place of dying for\nold spacemen. I haven't a dime except for the pittance the Holcomb\nFoundation calls a spaceman's pension. Yet I had millions in my hands.\nTreasure beyond your wildest dreams! Cursed treasure....\n  \n \n  You smile. You are thinking that I'm just an old man, beached\nearthside, spinning tall tales to impress the youngsters. Maybe,\nthinking about the kind of spacemen my generation produced, you have\nthe idea that if ever we'd so much as laid a hand on anything of value\nout in space we'd not let go until Hell froze over! Well, you're\nright about that. We didn't seek the spaceways for the advancement of\ncivilization or any of that Foundation bushwah, you can be certain of\nthat. We did it for\n   \n   us\n   \n  ... for Number One. That's the kind of men we\nwere, and we were proud of it. We hung onto what we found because the\nrisks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there.\nBut there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to\nall of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no\npart of the world of men, thick with danger—and horror.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_4]\nWillard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND—ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_3]\nSeven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  —Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night—for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time—Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk—the Ghost will come—for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_5]\nHe woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the\npassing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so\nmuch of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the\npoint of gibbering insanity.\n  \n \n  He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he\nnever remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to\nremove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n  \n \n  During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n  \n \n  Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n  \n \n  And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the\nyears he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . His dreams were vivid, peopled with men and women he had\nonce known, and were horrible with the fantasies of terror that years\nof solitary brooding had implanted deep in his mind.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_1]\nGALACTIC GHOST\n  \n \n  By WALTER KUBILIUS\n  \n \n  The Flying Dutchman of space was a harbinger\n   \n  of death. But Willard wasn't superstitions.\n   \n  He had seen the phantom—and lived.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1942.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The only friend in space Willard had ever known was dying. Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space.

The story first introduces the Ghost Ship as a legend, a supernatural omen that appears to dying spacemen. It is a harbinger of death and a symbol for those who are lost and will never return home. When Willard's friend Dobbin is dying, he sees the ship and believes it has come for him, cementing its role as a symbol of a lonely death in space.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    \"It's come—for me!\" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward Willard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow.\n    ##end_quote##\n\n2.  For Willard, who is left completely alone, the Ghost Ship becomes a complex symbol. During his profound isolation, the ship's appearance is a break in the maddening emptiness. When it leaves, he feels its absence, highlighting the depth of his loneliness to the point where even a phantom is better than nothing. The ship represents a connection, however ghostly, to other lost souls.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand as if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n    ##end_quote##\n\n3.  Ultimately, the Ghost Ship's true significance is revealed to be a literal, physical state rather than a supernatural one. It is the vessel for travelers who, after being isolated in space for too long, have lost their material substance relative to Earth. It represents the ultimate, inescapable loneliness: being forever cut off from home and humanity. Willard's \"rescue\" is his induction into this ghostly crew, turning his haunting memories of Earth into an eternal, unreachable torment.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the simple reason that we would go through it!\"\n\n##Answer: "}], "metadata": {"id": "258", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 2, "reference_answers": ["There are legends and tall tales about the Ghost Ships, told mainly by drunken men and professional storytellers. Willard remembers that there are stories on Earth about Ghost Ships that sail the Seven Seas. The story goes that the crews of Ghost Ships have broken a particular law, and their punishment is to roam forever. The Ghost Ship in space is said to be the home of spacemen who could not return to Earth. When Dobbin is dying, he claims to see the Ghost Ship and that it has come for him, but when Willard looks for the ship, he does not see it. Later, when Willard sees the Ghost Ship for himself for the first time, he tries to convince himself it is not really there. He remembers the stories about oceangoing Ghost Ships and reasons that there could also be Ghost Ships in space. When the Ghost Ship turns to leave, Willard is almost sorry to see it go because he has been so lonely. When the Ghost Ship appears to Willard for the second time, it has pulled alongside the Mary Lou, and Willard thinks it is a real ship. Only when the Ghost Ship abruptly speeds away and Willard sees stars shining through it does Willard realize it was the Ghost Ship, and he believes it is mocking him. With his third sighting of the Ghost Ship, Willard immediately thinks it is the Ghost Ship but then convinces himself it is not when it messages him. After he is on the ship, he realizes it is indeed the Ghost Ship and that he is now a Ghost. \n", "The Ghost Ship is a tale told by spacemen to frighten each other or warn them of this grave possibility. Many of those that came close to death in space, or those who witnessed others dying with no hope of a return to earth, mentioned seeing a ghost ship. A faint outline of a ship that had come to take them away forever. Before Dobbin’s death at the story of the story, he tells Willard that he sees the ghost ship. \nThis ghost ship serves as another form of torture for Willard during his many years of solitude. The ghost ship would essentially check up on him, float by and see if he was still alive or not. This gave Willard false hope as he would dream that the ghost ship was a real rocket ship that was coming to rescue him. In the end, Willard is taken away by a ghost ship, though he thinks it’s a rescue ship initially, and he is doomed to forever fly through the solar system as a ghost and nothing more. There is no hope for his return to Earth. The men of the ghost ship are truly ghosts, invisible to the naked eye and only visible to those on their deathbeds. \n", "The Ghost Ship is a legend that sailors and space travelers alike have claimed people see in the moments before they die at sea or in space. In the seconds before Dobbin dies in Willard’s arms, he looks out the window of the “Mary Lou” and claims to see the Ghost Ship himself. Throughout Willard’s long periods of solitude aboard the “Mary Lou”, he thinks he sees the Ghost Ship several times. First, from a distance, as a blinking light advancing closer and closer before turning back and sailing off into dark space; later, he thinks he sees the ship return, only this time it passes nearer before turning back and leaving again. With each return of the Ghost Ship, Willard believes he sees it clearer than he had before. After decades adrift in space, Willard believes a ship has finally come to rescue him. He does not think it is the Ghost Ship because it is solid, and he is greeted by a crew of people. However, the captain explains that the longer a vessel spends lost in space, the more it loses itself and slips into a kind of un-reality, along with those aboard. The more the “Mary Lou” drifted into this space, the more real the Ghost Ship became to Willard. Willard realizes that the “Mary Lou” has become a “ghost ship” herself.", "Ghost Ships frame the story and the idea of them haunts Willard on and off throughout it. At the beginning, when Dobbin exclaims that he sees a Ghost Ship prior to his death, Willard tells himself that it was a hallucination from somewhere deep in his dying friend’s subconscious, just the result of the memory of an old legend. However, the idea of a Ghost Ship never really leaves Willard’s mind throughout the rest of the story. When he sees a partially transparent rocket ship that turns away and disappears, he wonders if it could be a Ghost Ship but talks himself out of it. Later he wonders if it was a ghost ship that was “mocking him”. When he is rescued by a ship that looks more real, the thought still crosses his mind that it could be a Ghost Ship and he again shuts the idea down. Ultimately, Ghost Ships are incredibly significant in the story, because it turns out that both the Mary Lou, and his rescue ship/new home, while not exactly like the tall tale, are, in effect, Ghost Ships. \n"]}}

Dobbin's\nlips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his\nfingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the\n   \n   Mary\nLou\n   \n  were now black as meteor dust.\n  \n \n  \"We'll never see Earth again,\" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at\nthe cover.\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense!\" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man\nwould not see through the lie. \"We've got the sun's gravity helping\nus drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and\nwe'll start to work again on a new idea of mine....\" His voice trailed\nhelplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.\n  \n \n  The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His\nface contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.\n  \n \n  \"To see Earth again!\" he said weakly. \"To walk on solid ground once\nmore!\"\n  \n \n  \"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.\nNo man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be\nanguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no\nman could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of\nthe solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like\nDobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from\nnow, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in\nspace and bring them home again.\n  \n \n  Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted\nhim so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the\nstars.\n  \n \n  Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the\nheavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he\nfirst crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would\ndie a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any\nman could.\n  \n \n  Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a\ntremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.\n  \n \n  \"I saw it!\" his voice cracked, trembling.\n  \n \n  \"Saw what?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies!

Dobbin was now one\nwith the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.\n  \n \n  For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body\nof his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was\nnecessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had\never had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the\nuseless motors of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_6]\nHe awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought\nthat perhaps he might still be in the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . The warm, smiling face\nof a man quickly reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"I'll call the captain,\" the space man said. \"He said to let him know\nwhen you came to.\"\n  \n \n  Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He\npressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He\nyawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his\nentire body.\n  \n \n  He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his\nmind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year\nand perhaps not the next—for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian\nexpedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home\nbase Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at\nthe end of the trail.\n  \n \n  Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those\nyears, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.\n  \n \n  The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood\nup and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of\nhis ship, but he would manage.\n  \n \n  \"How do you feel, Space Man Willard?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, you know me?\" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,\n\"Of course, you looked through the log book of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very\nold man.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know how much I suffered there,\" Willard said slowly,\nmeasuring each word. \"Years in space—all alone! It's a horrible thing!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" the old captain said.\n  \n \n  \"Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the\nthought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me\nand help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have\ndied. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of\nvast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be\nnow!\"\n  \n \n  A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the\ncaptain's eyes.\n  \n \n  \"I want to walk on Earth just once—then I can die.\"\n  \n \n  Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.\n  \n \n  \"When will we go to Earth?\" he asked.\n  \n \n  The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged\nat him.\n  \n \n  \"You don't know,\" the Captain said. It was not a question or a\nstatement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.\n  \n \n  Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,\n   \n   he knew\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Matter is relative,\" he said, \"the existent under one condition is\nnon-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All\nthings that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass\nand energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened\nto the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years\nago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel\nthe change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became\nmore and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any\nEarth-ship that might have passed. We are real—to ourselves. But to\nsome ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen\nyears—to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.\n  \n \n  \"Then this ship,\" Willard said, stunned, \"you and I and everything on\nit...\"\n  \n \n  \"... are doomed,\" the Captain said. \"We cannot go to Earth for the\nsimple reason that we would go\n   \n   through\n   \n  it!\"\n  \n \n  The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth\nagain. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he\nwalked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of\nbirds. Never. Never. Never....\n  \n \n  \"Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_2]\nThe weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the\nship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged\nit had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care\nand attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.\nThe substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious\nfood and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.\n  \n \n  When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be\nthen that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes\nhe thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control\nboard, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in\nthe direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great\nloneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever\nknown would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair\nand hopeless pain.\n  \n \n  Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was\nsitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.\nA chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!\nDistinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,\nit dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He\nwatched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.\nAnd then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!\n  \n \n  Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished\ninstantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few\nminutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes\nwould help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass\nof fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a\nmoving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth\ninvestigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the\nlast flashing seconds of life.\n  \n \n  Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted\nits semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,\ninstead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused\nhis heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it\nwould reach the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing\nhis ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,\nthough dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something\nabout its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It\nresembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty\nyears ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though\nhalf-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a\nrocket ship.\n  \n \n  But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of\nany material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.\nBut the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the\npresence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.\n  \n \n  Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years\nin space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint\nghost-like rocket ships?\n  \n \n  The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!\nWas this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was\nimpossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales\ntold by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.\n  \n \n  \"There is no ship there. There is no ship there,\" Willard told himself\nover and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now\nmotionless a few hundred miles away.\n  \n \n  Deep within him a faint voice cried, \"\n   \n   It's come—for me!\n   \n  \" but Willard\nstilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.\nThere must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there\nhad been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas—ships doomed to roam\nforever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true\nfor the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?\n  \n \n  He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was\nnot nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A\nmoment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost\nShip was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand\nas if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.\n  \n \n  But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,\nfainter and fainter.\n  \n \n  Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket\nrecede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded\nloneliness of the stars descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_4]\nWillard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not\nbecause it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been\ningrained in him through the years.\n  \n \n  He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism\nof the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in\nperfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no\nspeed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All\nwas in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when\nthere was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,\nlong forgotten Earth.\n  \n \n  He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.\nHe arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being\nmarked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of\nthe stars, he suddenly froze.\n  \n \n  There was a ship, coming toward him!\n  \n \n  For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt\nassailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no\nphantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight\nshone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid\nand had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the\nGhost Ship in his youth.\n  \n \n \n \n  For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,\nhad gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.\n  \n \n  The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.\n  \n \n  \"CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,\" the message rapped out, \"CALLING SPACE\nSHIP MARY LOU.\"\n  \n \n  With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent\nthe answering message.\n  \n \n  \"SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!\"\n  \n \n  He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within\nhim and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened\nto the happiest message he had ever heard:\n  \n \n  \"NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU\nARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND—ARE YOU ABLE TO\nCOME?\"\n  \n \n  Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.\n  \n \n  \"YES! COMING!\"\n  \n \n  The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  .\nIn a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically\nglad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.\nHe realized suddenly that everything about the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  was hateful to\nhim. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty\nyears of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.\n  \n \n  He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.\n  \n \n  The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away\nand a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was\ntossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving\nthe\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  behind him forever.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor\nsay anything. His heart was choked with emotion.\n  \n \n  \"It's all right,\" a kindly voice assured him, \"You're safe now.\"\n  \n \n  He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in\nbed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.\n\n[Chapter: SPACEMAN_ON_A_SPREE_3]\nGirard-Perregaux was wagging his finger again, a gesture that,\nseemingly mild though it was, had an astonishing ability to break off\nthe conversation of one who debated with the easy-seeming, quiet spoken\nman.\n  \n \n  He said, \"No, he hasn't. Few there are who have, nowadays. Man has\nalways paid lip service to adventure, hardships and excitement, but in\nactuality his instincts, like those of any other animal, lead him to\nthe least dangerous path. Today we've reached the point where no one\nneed face danger—ever. There are few who don't take advantage of the\nfact. Including you and me, Lofting, and including Seymour Pond.\"\n  \n \n  His friend and colleague changed subjects abruptly, impatiently. \"Let's\nleave this blistering jabber about Pond's motivation and get to the\npoint. The man is the only trained space pilot in the world. It will\ntake months, possibly more than a year, to bring another novitiate\npilot to the point where he can safely be trusted to take our next\nexplorer craft out. Appropriations for our expeditions have been\nincreasingly hard to come by—even though in\n   \n   our\n   \n  minds, Hans, we are\nnear important breakthroughs, breakthroughs which might possibly so\nspark the race that a new dream to push man out to the stars will take\nhold of us. If it is admitted that our organization has degenerated\nto the point that we haven't a single pilot, then it might well be\nthat the Economic Planning Board, and especially those cloddies\non Appropriations, will terminate the whole Department of Space\nExploration.\"\n  \n \n  \"So....\" Girard-Perregaux said gently.\n  \n \n  \"So some way we've got to bring Seymour Pond out of his retirement!\"\n  \n \n  \"Now we are getting to matters.\" Girard-Perregaux nodded his agreement.\nLooking over the rim of his glass, his eyes narrowed in thought as his\nface took on an expression of Machiavellianism. \"And do not the ends\njustify the means?\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin blinked at him.\n  \n \n  The other chuckled. \"The trouble with you, Lofting, is that you have\nfailed to bring history to bear on our problem. Haven't you ever read\nof the sailor and his way of life?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sailor? What in the name of the living Zoroaster has the sailor got to\ndo with it?\"\n  \n \n  \"You must realize, my dear Lofting, that our Si Pond is nothing more\nthan a latter-day sailor, with many of the problems and view-points,\ntendencies and weaknesses of the voyager of the past. Have you never\nheard of the seaman who dreamed of returning to the village of his\nbirth and buying a chicken farm or some such? All the long months at\nsea—and sometimes the tramp freighters or whaling craft would be out\nfor years at a stretch before returning to home port—he would talk\nof his retirement and his dream. And then? Then in port, it would be\none short drink with the boys, before taking his accumulated pay and\nheading home. The one short drink would lead to another. And morning\nwould find him, drunk, rolled, tattooed and possibly sleeping it off in\njail. So back to sea he'd have to go.\"\n  \n \n  Gubelin grunted bitterly. \"Unfortunately, our present-day sailor\ncan't be separated from his money quite so easily. If he could, I'd\npersonally be willing to lure him down some dark alley, knock him over\nthe head and roll him myself. Just to bring him back to his job again.\"\n  \n \n  He brought his wallet from his pocket, and flicked it open to his\nuniversal credit card. \"The ultimate means of exchange,\" he grunted.\n\"Nobody can spend your money, but you, yourself.

But there was enough sanity in his mind to\nalso realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the\nvalue of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental\nshock of moving about among his people back on Earth.\n  \n \n  During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing\nit with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his\nfriends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'\nsleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.\nAnd each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and\nconfused.\n  \n \n  Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no\nlonger was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But\nthere was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they\nrefused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual\nrunning of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,\nthey mumbled and drifted away.\n  \n \n  And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one\nnight while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth\nswimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the\nyears he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . His dreams were vivid, peopled with men and women he had\nonce known, and were horrible with the fantasies of terror that years\nof solitary brooding had implanted deep in his mind.\n\n[Chapter: GALACTIC_GHOST_3]\nSeven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard\nwould never see there was published a small item:\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Arden, Rocketport\n   \n  —Thirteen years ago the Space Ship\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the\nexploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been\nseen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is\nplanning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called\n   \n   Mary Lou II\n   \n  , in memory of his father.\"\n  \n \n  Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the\ncold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only\nthings both dear and precious to him.\n  \n \n  Willard, master and lone survivor of the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  , knew this well for\nhe had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the\nanguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be\ndone.\n  \n \n  And so it was that each night—for Willard did not give up the\nEarth-habit of keeping time—Willard dreamed of the days he had known\non Earth.\n  \n \n  In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and\nfeeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his\nfeet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.\nHow beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and\nfriendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would\nnever see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers\nand scientists.\n  \n \n  Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the\nshops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd\nthat he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a\nman who is alone.\n  \n \n  Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,\nfor example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really\nonly a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had\nseen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different\nsituations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But\nperhaps space itself denies reason.\n  \n \n  Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here\nand a story there put together all that he knew:\n  \n \n  Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost\nShip haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its\ntragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.\nWhen your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a\nlifeless hulk—the Ghost will come—for you!\n  \n \n  And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy\nship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.\nBitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.\n  \n \n  Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost\ntrack of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose\ncould time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there\nreason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became\nmeaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About\nthree years must have passed since his last record in the log book\nof the\n   \n   Mary Lou\n   \n  . At that time, he remembered, he suffered another\ngreat disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a\nfull-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with\njoy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy\nwas short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly\ndisappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a\ndistant star\n   \n   through\n   \n  the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon\nhim. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.\n  \n \n  Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague\nfear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting\nand watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.\n  \n \n  How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no\nlonger a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.\nPerhaps twenty.

Willard's internal monologue reveals the depth of his feelings for Dobbin, especially as he faces losing him.\n\n**Step 2: Describe their shared existential crisis.**\nBoth men are stranded in space aboard the damaged *Mary Lou* and are overwhelmed by a profound longing for Earth, a feeling Willard refers to as \"Earth-loneliness.\" They have been away for four years and understand each other's anguish without needing to say much. This shared suffering is a core component of their bond. The text states:\n##begin_quote##\"Four years!\" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.

From his private\noffice-cabin, he sent a message to Chief Astronomer Zost Relyul to\nnotify him as soon as Earth's surface features became clear; then he\nsat idle, alone with his thoughts.\n  \n \n  The ship's automatic mechanisms had scant need of tending; Knof Llud\nfound himself wishing that he could find some back-breaking task for\neveryone on board, himself included, to fill up the hours that remained.\n  \n \n  There was an extensive and well-chosen film library in the cabin, but\nhe couldn't persuade himself to kill time that way. He could go down\nand watch the screens, or to the family apartment where he might find\nLesra and the children—but somehow he didn't want to do that either.\n  \n \n  He felt empty, drained—like his ship. As the\n   \n   Quest III's\n   \n  fuel stores\nand the hope of success in man's mightiest venture had dwindled, so the\nstrength had gone out of him. Now the last fuel compartment was almost\nempty and Captain Knof Llud felt tired and old.\n  \n \n  Perhaps, he thought, he was feeling the weight of his nine hundred\nEarth years—though physically he was only forty now, ten years older\nthan when the voyage had begun. That was the foreshortening along the\ntime axis of a space ship approaching the speed of light. Weeks and\nmonths had passed for the\n   \n   Quest III\n   \n  in interstellar flight while\nyears and decades had raced by on the home world.\n  \n \n  Bemusedly Llud got to his feet and stood surveying a cabinet with\nbuilt-in voice recorder and pigeonholes for records. There were about\nthree dozen film spools there—his personal memoirs of the great\nexpedition, a segment of his life and of history. He might add that to\nthe ship's official log and its collections of scientific data, as a\nreport to whatever powers might be on Earth now—if such powers were\nstill interested.\n  \n \n  Llud selected a spool from among the earliest. It was one he had made\nshortly after leaving Procyon, end of the first leg of the trip. He\nslid it onto the reproducer.\n  \n \n  His own voice came from the speaker, fresher, more vibrant and\nconfident than he knew it was now.\n  \n \n  \"One light-day out from Procyon, the thirty-third day by ship's time\nsince leaving Earth.\n  \n \n  \"Our visit to Procyon drew a blank. There is only one huge planet, twice\nthe size of Jupiter, and like Jupiter utterly unfit to support a colony.\n  \n \n  \"Our hopes were dashed—and I think all of us, even remembering the\nCentaurus Expedition's failure, hoped more than we cared to admit. If\nProcyon had possessed a habitable planet, we could have returned after\nan absence of not much over twenty years Earth time.\n  \n \n  \"It is cheering to note that the crew seems only more resolute. We go\non to Capella; its spectrum, so like our own Sun's, beckons. If success\ncomes there, a century will have passed before we can return to Earth;\nfriends, relatives, all the generation that launched the\n   \n   Quest\n   \n  ships\nwill be long since dead. Nevertheless we go on. Our generation's dream,\nhumanity's dream, lives in us and in the ship forever....\"\n  \n \n  Presently Knof Llud switched off that younger voice of his and leaned\nback, an ironic smile touching his lips. That fervent idealism seemed\nremote and foreign to him now. The fanfares of departure must still\nhave been ringing in his ears.\n  \n \n  He rose, slipped the record back in its niche and picked out another,\nlater, one.\n  \n \n  \"One week since we passed close enough to Aldebaran to ascertain that\nthat system, too, is devoid of planets.\n  \n \n  \"We face the unpleasant realization that what was feared is probably\ntrue—that worlds such as the Sun's are a rare accident, and that we\nmay complete our search without finding even one new Earth.\n  \n \n  \"It makes no difference, of course; we cannot betray the plan....\nThis may be man's last chance of escaping his pitiful limitation to\none world in all the Universe. Certainly the building of this ship\nand its two sisters, the immense expenditure of time and labor and\nenergy stores that went into them, left Earth's economy drained and\nexhausted. Only once in a long age does mankind rise to such a selfless\nand transcendent effort—the effort of Egypt that built the pyramids,\nor the war efforts of the nations in the last great conflicts of the\ntwentieth century.\n  \n \n  \"Looked at historically, such super-human outbursts of energy are\nthe result of a population's outgrowing its room and resources, and\ntherefore signalize the beginning of the end. Population can be\nlimited, but the price is a deadly frustration, because growth alone is\nlife.... In our day the end of man's room for growth on the Earth was\nin sight—so we launched the\n   \n   Quests\n   \n  . Perhaps our effort will prove as\nfutile as pyramid-building, less practical than orgies of slaughter to\nreduce pressure.... In any case, it would be impossible to transport\nvery many people to other stars; but Earth could at least go into\nits decline with the knowledge that its race went onward and upward,\nexpanding limitlessly into the Universe....\n  \n \n  \"Hopeless, unless we find planets!\"\n\n[Chapter: CULTURAL_EXCHANGE_1]\nCULTURAL EXCHANGE\n  \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  It was a simple student exchange—but\n   \n  Retief gave them more of\n   \n  an education than they expected!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  Second Secretary Magnan took his green-lined cape and orange-feathered\nberet from the clothes tree. \"I'm off now, Retief,\" he said. \"I hope\nyou'll manage the administrative routine during my absence without any\nunfortunate incidents.\"\n  \n \n  \"That seems a modest enough hope,\" Retief said. \"I'll try to live up to\nit.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't appreciate frivolity with reference to this Division,\" Magnan\nsaid testily. \"When I first came here, the Manpower Utilization\nDirectorate, Division of Libraries and Education was a shambles.

Councillor Retief is not interested. Magnan specifically suggests that Retief sponsor the group SCARS (Sexual, Cultural and Athletic Recreational Society), and warns Retief that the rival Groaci may fill any void. Retief suggests researching the youth groups before giving them money. Magnan is dismissive. Retief is still not interested, and leaves to go look at plans for a new passenger liner being built by the Fustians. \nRetief takes a flat-car to the ship yard and meets Whonk, who is a shipyard clerk. He asks to see the blueprints, which he photographs. He and Whonk chat about the attitude of the youth, and Whonk blames it on their new leader, Slock, who hangs around with Yith, a member of the Groaci embassy.\nLater, while Retief is on his way home to dress for a dinner and press event organized by Magnan, two Fustian youths threaten him on the bus. Retief realizes that they were after his photos, which showed that the ship under construction was a battle cruiser, not a passenger liner. He also realizes that Whonk may be in danger. Retief escapes the youths and races back to the shipyard to find that Whonk has been dragged off and tied up in a warehouse. From the Fustian’s wounds, Retief realized that they had tried to kill him.\nRetief figures out that the Fustian youths have taken some titanite, an explosive, over to a ship called the Moss Rock, which would be full of dignitaries later. He and Whonk race over there and encounter more Fustians, and win a fight with them, effectively breaking up the Groaci-backed plot to blow up the ship. \nRetief arrives at the banquet a little late, and exchanges a few words with Magnan, who proceeds to make the Fustians miserable with his cultural insensitivity. A few minutes later, the SCARS leader, Slock, arrives. Retief reveals Slock’s plan: Slock, backed by the Groaci, was planning to take over Fust. The Groaci tried to frame the Terrestrial Embassy for the plot.\nSlock escaped. Retief went back toward the Moss Rock, where Whonk tackled Slock, and Retief accosted Yith. Whonk wanted to take revenge on Yith for attacking him earlier, but Retief instead negotiated a deal in which Yith, who had mastered removing the Fustian carapace surgically, which would be a great relief to Whonk and other elders, would agree to do so in return for not being ritually dismembered. Just as this agreement was completed, Slock tried to escape again, but Whonk dumped him on the Moss Rock, and set the autopilot for Groaci, still full of titanite. It blew up on the way there.\nMagnan wrested what he could, diplomatically speaking, from the wreckage of the youth sponsorship program and moved on to plans to sponsor Senior Citizens Groups.\n", "This story follows Retief, a Terrestrial diplomat working on the surface of the Fustian planet, where these two species co-exist with the Groaci. At the start of the story, Retief is talking to the Terrestrial Ambassador about a new program that the Fustians are looking for sponsorship for, that the Ambassador wants Retief to take care of. Retief, the Councillor, does not seem interested, and heads out to the shipyards to ask the people there some questions about a new ship being built. An older Fustian named Whonk allows him to see the plans for the ship and tells Retief about Slock, one of the local leaders of the Youths that seems to be a bad influence. These troublesome characters showed up to talk to Whonk and scare Retief off of the docks as Retief slips out unnoticed. He finds plans in the Embassy's library for an old battle cruiser that match the plans for the new ship, pointing him towards a plot to re-introduce weapons into the society. He finds Whonk, injured from the others' attempt to extract information from him, and the two of them piece together the clues: there was titanite, a dangerous explosive, that is going to be placed on the fanciest boat at the docks, the Moss Rock. When they get to that ship to take a look, they find a variety of items emblazoned with the logo of SCARS, the Youth Group that Ambassador Magnan wanted Retief to sponsor at the beginning. Retief figures that these items are here as planted false evidence, so that the explosion would be pinned on the Youth Group, and thus the Terrestrials by extension. Retief's goal is to destroy this plot--Whonk captures a Fustian who they realize has had his shell surgically removed, something that they thought impossible. Retief takes this to mean that the Groaci have more medical knowledge than they realized, and that they are responsible for this plot. In order to expose this plan, he heads to the banquet where the sponsorship of the Youth Group is being announced. He interrupts the Ambassador's grand announcement, exposing the plot to the press that was already gathered there. He knew Slock to be a gang leader, told everyone of the plan to blow up the Moss Rock and his deal with the Groaci, and then runs toward the boat with Whonk and the Ambassador. Whonk wanted to follow through with his society's classic ceremonial revenge against Yith, the Groaci at the ship, but Retief convinces them to have a sort of trade: Yith would share the medical knowledge to remove Whonk's heavy outer shell so that it would no longer be a nuisance and a heavyweight, and Slock is thrown onto the Moss Rock as it leaves the docks and explodes. With the plot exposed, the Ambassador wants to move on to more social projects, but Retief heads out for a fishing vacation with his new friend Whonk.", "The story begins with a meeting between Ambassador Magnan and Councillor Retief, who represents the Terrestrial Embassy on the planet Fust. The planet is populated with turtle-like creatures called Fustians (the younger Fustians lack the hard shell of the mature ones). Magnan assigns Retief the mission of sponsoring a new youth movement there called the Sexual, Cultural, Athletic Recreational Society (SCARS). Instead, Retief prefers to investigate a new passenger ship being built by the Fustians. Upon his arrival at the shipyard, Retief meets Whonk, an elderly Fustian who maintains documents, and he shows Retief the blueprints for the new ship. A young Fustian named Slock enters and arouses Retief’s suspicions by inquiring what he wants with the plans. After he leaves the shipyard, Retief is attacked by two young Fustians, and he returns to find Whonk has been attacked as well. Retief notices a stain on the ground that Whonk tells him is a remnant of four drums belonging to the Groaci—an alien species that operated a competing embassy. Retief had seen interacting a Groaci attache interacting with the youth that had attacked him earlier. The drums had been loaded onto a boat called \"Moss Rock.\" After identifying the smelly stain as an explosive called titanite, Retief and Whonk go to \"Moss Rock\" and discover a box containing a SCARS uniform. While there, they are attacked by an older-looking youth Fustian and discover that he is not a youth at all; rather, his shell has been removed by some mysterious method. They ward off another attack by his friends, and Retief decides to head to the sponsorship ceremony, realizing that the Groaci are likely taking advantage of the SCARS group's distaste for Fustian leadership to advance their plot to bomb \"Moss Rock\". At the sponsorship ceremony, Ambassador Magnan introduces Slock as guest of honor, and Retief and Whonk seize the opportunity to apprehend him and explain his deal with the Groaci to the press: The Groaci would supply weapons, and Slock would make sure they were installed on the ship. The SCARS uniforms found at the scene of the exploded ship would implicate them along with the Terrestrial Embassy, because of its sponsorship of SCARS. Magnan notes that Slock was scheduled to be on the ship, and Retief rebuts that this reveals the Groaci's intention to get rid of Slock after he'd done their bidding. Thus, the disaster at \"Moss Rock\" would cement the Groaci's control of Fust. Retief returns to the \"Moss Rock\" and captures the Groaci diplomat Yith, and Whonk captures Slock, whom they both discover has also had his shell surgically removed to appear younger. Retief makes a deal with Whonk to spare Yith's life in exchange for the same shell-removal surgery. Whonk takes his revenge on Slock by placing him back on the \"Moss Rock\" and exploding the ship with the titanite barrels on its course to Groaci. Retief informs Magnan that this display will prevent the Groaci from pursuing any further action against Fust.", "Ambassador Magnan wants Retief, the Councillor working with him at the Terrestrial Embassy, to sponsor the Fustian youth group the Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society (SCARS), but Retief isn’t interested. Instead, he wants to check out the new passenger liner that the Fustians are building, but he does express concern about the Groaci’s interest in Fust, which has a steel-age manufacturing economy while Groaci is into crude atomics. At the shipyards, an old Fustian named Whonk shows him the blueprints for the new passenger liner. Retief takes photographs of the blueprints to study them later. Slock, a young Fustian, comes with a Groaci Embassy military attache and beats up on Whonk while Retief sneaks out the back.\n\nLater in the day, Retief has to attend a dinner where the sponsor for the SCARS youth group will be announced. On the way, he is accosted by two Fustain youth who tell him they want the films for the pictures he took of the blueprints. Retief manages to elude them. He has looked at pictures and realized they are plans for a replica of a battlecruiser used two hundred years ago and has gun placements. Retief realizes that Whonk must have told them about his pictures and knows that he wouldn’t tell them willingly, so he goes to Whonk’s office to look for him. He sees signs of a struggle and finds Whonk tied up behind some bales where he is out of sight. Whonk reveals he was attacked by a Groaci, Slock, and his cohorts, and they tried to kill him. Retief recognizes the smell of an explosive, and Whonk tells him drums of it have been placed on a barge called Moss Rock. \n\nRetief and Whonk decide to go back to the Embassy but are attacked by one of the young Fustians who attacked Whonk earlier that day. As they wrestle with him, they pull off his cloak to discover that his carapace has been removed, so he isn’t really a youth. Whonk is stunned because he believed it wasn’t possible to remove a carapace without killing the Fustian. \n\nAt the dinner, Magnan announces that Retief has won the “bidding” to sponsor the SCARS. Retief sneaks up on Slock and tells Magnan that he has figured out that the Groaci are planning to take over a local world and then branch out to more worlds. They have been using the young Fustians to help them set up their attack but planned to kill them after everything was ready. Retief catches a Groaci, and Whonk wants to kill him, but Retief gets him to promise to have the Groaci surgeon remove the carapaces from the older Fustians like Whonk. When Retief reports the scheme to Magnan, he tells his superior that the Moss Rock is headed for Groaci and will explode there, ending their problems with the Groaci.\n"]}}

More dramatic, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, \"I'm gratified to\nsee you entering into the spirit of the event at last.\" He turned his\nattention back to the assembled guests. \"If our honored guest will join\nme on the rostrum...?\" he said. \"The gentlemen of the press may want to\ncatch a few shots of the presentation.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room,\ntook his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras.\n  \n \n  \"How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the\ngreat pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,\" he said, talking slowly\nfor the benefit of the scribbling reporters. \"We'd like to think that\nin our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve\nduring the years ahead.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low\nsteps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the\nnewcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.\n  \n \n  Retief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.\nSlock stared at him, drew back.\n  \n \n  \"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk\ntold you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?\nIt was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're\nbuilding.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  With a bellow Slock reached for Retief—and choked off in mid-cry as\nthe Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear\nof the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.\n\"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.\nThe Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman\nat the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.\nThe next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed\nby a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby\nworlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This\ngroup was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\"\n  \n \n  \"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back\nto Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was\nplanned for today. When the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  blew, a variety of clues were\nto be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all\nover them.

This is idiotic.\nSlock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\"\n  \n \n  Slock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip\nloosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting\nhis way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan\nwatched, open-mouthed.\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They\nintended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their\npurpose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is\nthe ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase.\n  \n \n  Retief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much\nchance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\"\n  \n \n  Ten minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through\nnow,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled\nthrough to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in\nWhonk's wake.\n  \n \n  In the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a\ncode letter. No reply. He tried another.\n  \n \n  \"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's\nloose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_4]\nThe second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n  \n \n  \"Retief—I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\n  \n \n  Retief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\n  \n \n  Outside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\n  \n \n  Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\n  \n \n  Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n  \n \n  \"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n  \n \n  \"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n  \n \n  \"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\n  \n \n  The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\n  \n \n  So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\n  \n \n  And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\n  \n \n  But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer—and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\n  \n \n  At least not willingly....\n  \n \n  Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_10]\n\"It was quite a bang,\" said Retief. \"But I guess you saw it, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, confound it,\" Magnan said. \"When I remonstrated with Hulk, or\nWhelk—\"\n  \n \n  \"Whonk.\"\n  \n \n  \"—the ruffian thrust me into an alley bound in my own cloak.

Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\n  \n \n  The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n  \n \n  \"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n  \n \n  \"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n  \n \n  \"The police—\"\n  \n \n  \"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's behind it?\"\n  \n \n  \"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n  \n \n  \"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n  \n \n  \"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n  \n \n  \"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n  \n \n  \"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\n  \n \n  He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_6]\nA stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\n  \n \n  Retief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\n  \n \n  The Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\n   \n   Lament of\nHatching\n   \n  ,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments—\"\n  \n \n  \"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment—\"\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n  \n \n  \"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n  \n \n  \"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\n  \n \n  The minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness—\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_9]\nRetief whistled. \"So the Youths aren't all as young as they look.\nSomebody's been holding out on the rest of you Fustians!\"\n  \n \n  \"The Soft One,\" Whonk said. \"You laid him by the heels, Retief. I saw.\nProduce him now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on a minute, Whonk. It won't do you any good—\"\n  \n \n  Whonk winked broadly. \"I must take my revenge!\" he roared. \"I shall\ntest the texture of the Soft One! His pulped remains will be scoured up\nby the ramp-washers and mailed home in bottles!\"\n  \n \n  Retief whirled at a sound, caught up with the scuttling Yith fifty feet\naway, hauled him back to Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"It's up to you, Whonk,\" he said. \"I know how important ceremonial\nrevenge is to you Fustians. I will not interfere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Mercy!\" Yith hissed, eye-stalks whipping in distress. \"I claim\ndiplomatic immunity!\"\n  \n \n  \"No diplomat am I,\" rumbled Whonk. \"Let me see; suppose I start with\none of those obscenely active eyes—\" He reached....\n  \n \n  \"I have an idea,\" said Retief brightly. \"Do you suppose—just this\nonce—you could forego the ceremonial revenge if Yith promised to\narrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace you elders?\"\n  \n \n  \"But,\" Whonk protested, \"those eyes! What a pleasure to pluck them, one\nby one!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yess,\" hissed Yith, \"I swear it! Our most expert surgeons ... platoons\nof them, with the finest of equipment.\"\n  \n \n  \"I have dreamed of how it would be to sit on this one, to feel him\nsquash beneath my bulk....\"\n  \n \n  \"Light as a whissle feather shall you dance,\" Yith whispered.\n\"Shell-less shall you spring in the joy of renewed youth—\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe just one eye,\" said Whonk grudgingly. \"That would leave him\nfour.\"\n  \n \n  \"Be a sport,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Well.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's a deal then,\" said Retief. \"Yith, on your word as a diplomat,\nan alien, a soft-back and a skunk, you'll set up the mission. Groaci\nsurgical skill is an export that will net you more than armaments.\nIt will be a whissle feather in your cap—if you bring it off. And\nin return, Whonk won't sit on you. And I won't prefer charges of\ninterference in the internal affairs of a free world.\"\n  \n \n  Behind Whonk there was a movement. Slock, wriggling free of the\nborrowed carapace, struggled to his feet ... in time for Whonk to seize\nhim, lift him high and head for the entry to the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"Hey,\" Retief called. \"Where are you going?\"\n  \n \n  \"I would not deny this one his reward,\" called Whonk. \"He hoped to\ncruise in luxury. So be it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"That tub is loaded with titanite!\"\n  \n \n  \"Stand not in my way, Retief. For this one in truth owes me a\nvengeance.\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as the immense Fustian bore his giant burden up the ramp\nand disappeared within the ship.\n  \n \n  \"I guess Whonk means business,\" he said to Yith, who hung in his grasp,\nall five eyes goggling. \"And he's a little too big for me to stop.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk reappeared, alone, climbed down.\n  \n \n  \"What did you do with him?\" said Retief. \"Tell him you were going to—\"\n  \n \n  \"We had best withdraw,\" said Whonk. \"The killing radius of the drive is\nfifty yards.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean—\"\n  \n \n  \"The controls are set for Groaci. Long-may-he-sleep.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_8]\nIn the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a low\ncloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue. The\nthree mounted a passing flat-car. Whonk squatted, resting the weight of\nhis immense shell on the heavy plank flooring.\n  \n \n  \"Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth we\nbludgeoned aboard the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  ,\" he sighed. \"Soon will I be forced\ninto retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as I\nwill rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-daily\nfeedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is no\npleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismal\noutlook for one's next thousand years!\"\n  \n \n  \"You two carry on to the police station,\" said Retief. \"I want to play\na hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.\"\n  \n \n  \"What—?\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"As you wish, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumped\ndown, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stood\nvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.\n  \n \n  \"That's the trouble with a peaceful world,\" Retief muttered. \"No police\nprotection.\" He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a\nposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring\nblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed\nwrong....\n  \n \n  There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.\n  \n \n  Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had\nreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A\nsmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headed\noff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite side\nof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing\nGroaci.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Yith,\" he said, \"how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Release me, Retief!\" the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat\nbladder pulsating in agitation. \"The behemoths vie for the privilege of\ndismembering me out of hand!\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.\"\n  \n \n  \"I appeal to you,\" Yith whispered hoarsely. \"As a fellow diplomat, a\nfellow alien, a fellow soft-back—\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk?\" said Retief. \"Now\nkeep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.\"\n  \n \n  The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to the\nground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was\non its back, helpless.\n  \n \n  \"That's Whonk, still on his feet,\" said Retief. \"I wonder who he's\ncaught—and why.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk came toward the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  dragging the supine Fustian, who\nkicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind the\nsentry box. \"Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I can\noutrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.\" He stepped out and\nhailed Whonk.\n  \n \n  Puffing like a steam engine Whonk pulled up before him. \"Sleep,\nRetief!\" He panted. \"You followed a hunch; I did the same. I saw\nsomething strange in this one when we passed him on the avenue. I\nwatched, followed him here. Look! It is Slock, strapped into a dead\ncarapace! Now many things become clear.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_2]\nMagnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shuddered. \"Please—never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\n  \n \n  Retief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters—such as working with\nYouth groups—would create a far better impression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n  \n \n  \"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n  \n \n  \"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\n  \n \n  It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n  \n \n  \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n  \n \n  \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_5]\nThe door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n  \n \n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n  \n \n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n  \n \n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n  \n \n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n  \n \n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n  \n \n  \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n  \n \n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n  \n \n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me—in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n  \n \n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n  \n \n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n  \n \n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n  \n \n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\n   \n   Moss\nRock\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it—a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n  \n \n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy—fast.\"\n  \n \n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n  \n \n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n  \n \n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n  \n \n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n  \n \n  The youth gurgled.\n  \n \n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n  \n \n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n  \n \n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian—\n  \n \n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought—\"\n  \n \n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n  \n \n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n  \n \n  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n  \n \n  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n  \n \n  \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk.

He is also a spineless, political wind-sniffing clod. His main role, or function in the story is as a foil to the hero, Retief. Magnan’s clueless blathering sets up Retief’s dry, sarcastic remarks – remarks which, if Magnan were not so oblivious, would perhaps offend Magnan to the point of firing Retief. \nWhile Retief is running around Fust getting into fist fights and spoiling terrorists’ plots, Magnan is back at the office shuffling whatever papers came in from the Terrestrial Embassy that day, implementing the “program of the week.” Magnan is flat. Retief is three-dimensional.\nMagnan’s main contributions to the story are to: \n1.\tIgnore Retief’s advice to check out the Fustian youth organizations before sponsoring them, which leads to the potential for the Terrestrial Embassy being embarrassed by the Groaci attempts to frame SCARS for the explosion they hoped to cause aboard the Moss Rock. \n2.\tSet up the banquet to honor SCARS where he grossly insults his Fustian counterparts by having the hired musicians play a dirge, the “Lament of Hatching,” and then shattering their ear drums by tapping on his wine glass.\n3.\tWhip up a meringue of obfuscation to hide the fiasco of the youth organization sponsorship program and try to make himself smell like a rose in the process\n4.\tStart a new sponsorship program for Fustian Senior Citizens.\nAt no point in the story does he do anything useful at all.\n", "Magnan is the Terrestrial Ambassador to the Fustians. He is the figurehead of their influence on the Fustian planet, and works closely with Retief, the Terrestrial diplomat who uncovers a plot against the Terrestrials through the course of the story. He is the man who tries to convince Retief to sponsor the Youth Group SCARS in the beginning of the story, and we encounter him at the banquet near the end of the story. As the figurehead, he is responsible for announcing the role of the Terrestrials in funding the Youth Group, which creates an opportunity for Retief to announce the Grocian plot to everyone. Ambassador Magnan eventually joins Retief and Whonk as they leave the event to stop the criminals, but he is thrown into an alley by Whonk and doesn't have an opportunity to help directly. After the issue is dealt with by Whonk and Retief, Magnan resumes normal duty, and as the story ends he is looking at other groups that his government could potentially fund.\n", "Magnan is an ambassador with the Terrestrial Embassy, and he assigns Retief the mission to sponsor the new youth movement (SCARS) on the planet Fust. Magnan seems eager for this sponsorship to proceed despite his general ignorance about the movement itself. His motivation for speed rather than understanding may be attributed to the haste with which the Groaci Embassy has moved to establish a connection with SCARS. Magnan, of course, is not aware of the secret dealings between the Groaci and the SCARS, whom they are working with to ultimately supplant the Fustian leadership and take control of the planet for themselves. Magnan’s vision is fairly straightforward and views this sponsorship as the surest way to curry good favor with the Fustians (and get good publicity for the Terrestrial Embassy). Magnan is impatient with Retief’s more meticulous, fact-finding methods and organizes the sponsorship ceremony before Retief has completed his research. At the ceremony, Magnan’s interactions with the Fustian minister reveal further his humorous ignorance about their species, particularly when he hurts their sensitive hearing by banging his glass louder and louder. After he invites Slock on stage to present him to the press as his guest of honor and representative of SCARS, Whonk and Retief capture Slock and expose his plan to Magnan. At first, Magnan does not believe them, but he is quickly convinced when Slock escapes. In the end, Magnan creates a story for the press that the sponsorship event was a ruse to apprehend the perpetrators of the attempted coup against the Fustian leadership. ", "Magnan is the Ambassador at the Terrestrial Embassy on Fust and Councillor Retief’s boss. He wants Retief to sponsor the SCARS and stops just short of ordering him to do so. Magnan is very focused on his role as Ambassador and has little interest in anything not directly connected to his job. Magnan is not concerned about the passenger ship the Fustians are building or the fact that the Groacis are interested in the Fustians when their lives and economies are so different from each other. When Retief mentions the fact that the Groacis are interested in fission bombs, Magnan’s reaction is to wonder what market there could be for such devices since the world is at peace. He is politically correct and is shocked when Retief mentions the carapaces that the older Fustians has. He also pretends that he can hear the Fustians’ music when he clearly isn’t able to do so. Magnan is manipulative because he announces that Retief will sponsor SCARS even after Retief clearly tells him he is not interested. He misjudges character and refers to Slock as a fine young fellow when Slock is rude, violent, and mixed up in the scheme with the Groacis to begin conquering nearby worlds. At the end of the story when Magnan finally learns of the deceit of the young Fustians and the Groacis, he tries to act like he knew about it all along. His disinterest in anything not related to diplomacy gives Retief the leeway he needs to figure out the Fustian and Groaci crimes."]}}

A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n  \n \n  \"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n  \n \n  \"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n  \n \n  \"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n  \n \n  \"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\n  \n \n  He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_7]\n\"Why, that's our guest of honor,\" said Magnan, \"a fine young fellow!\nSlop I believe his name is.\"\n  \n \n  \"Slock,\" said Retief. \"Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness. And—\"\n  \n \n  Magnan rose and tapped on his glass. The Fustians winced at the, to\nthem, supersonic vibrations. They looked at each other muttering.\nMagnan tapped louder. The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some\nof the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose.\nMagnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green\nwine gushed on the tablecloth.\n  \n \n  \"What in the name of the Great Egg!\" the Minister muttered. He blinked,\nbreathing deeply.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, forgive me,\" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine.\n  \n \n  \"Too bad the glass gave out,\" said Retief. \"In another minute you'd\nhave cleared the hall. And then maybe I could have gotten a word in\nsideways. There's a matter you should know about—\"\n  \n \n  \"Your attention, please,\" Magnan said, rising. \"I see that our fine\nyoung guest has arrived, and I hope that the remainder of his committee\nwill be along in a moment. It is my pleasure to announce that our Mr.\nRetief has had the good fortune to win out in the keen bidding for the\npleasure of sponsoring this lovely group.\"\n  \n \n  Retief tugged at Magnan's sleeve. \"Don't introduce me yet,\" he said. \"I\nwant to appear suddenly. More dramatic, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, \"I'm gratified to\nsee you entering into the spirit of the event at last.\" He turned his\nattention back to the assembled guests. \"If our honored guest will join\nme on the rostrum...?\" he said. \"The gentlemen of the press may want to\ncatch a few shots of the presentation.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room,\ntook his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras.\n  \n \n  \"How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the\ngreat pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,\" he said, talking slowly\nfor the benefit of the scribbling reporters. \"We'd like to think that\nin our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve\nduring the years ahead.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low\nsteps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the\nnewcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.\n  \n \n  Retief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.\nSlock stared at him, drew back.\n  \n \n  \"You know me, Slock,\" said Retief loudly. \"An old fellow named Whonk\ntold you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?\nIt was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're\nbuilding.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  With a bellow Slock reached for Retief—and choked off in mid-cry as\nthe Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear\nof the floor.\n  \n \n  \"Glad you reporters happened along,\" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.\n\"Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.\nThe Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman\nat the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.\nThe next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed\nby a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby\nworlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan found his tongue. \"Are you mad, Retief?\" he screeched. \"This\ngroup was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!\"\n  \n \n  \"The Ministry's overdue for a purge,\" snapped Retief. He turned back\nto Slock. \"I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was\nplanned for today. When the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  blew, a variety of clues were\nto be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all\nover them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair\nsquarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship\nof the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.\"\n  \n \n  \"The\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  ?\" said Magnan. \"But that was—Retief! This is idiotic.\nSlock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!\"\n  \n \n  Slock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip\nloosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting\nhis way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan\nwatched, open-mouthed.\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,\" Retief said. \"They\nintended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their\npurpose.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, don't stand there,\" yelped Magnan over the uproar. \"If Slock is\nthe ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!\" He moved to give chase.\n  \n \n  Retief grabbed his arm. \"Don't jump down there! You'd have as much\nchance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.\"\n  \n \n  Ten minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. \"We can get through\nnow,\" Whonk called. \"This way.\" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled\nthrough to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in\nWhonk's wake.\n  \n \n  In the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a\ncode letter. No reply. He tried another.\n  \n \n  \"No good,\" he said after a full minute had passed. \"Wonder what's\nloose?\" He slammed the phone back in its niche. \"Let's grab a cab.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_8]\nIn the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a low\ncloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue. The\nthree mounted a passing flat-car. Whonk squatted, resting the weight of\nhis immense shell on the heavy plank flooring.\n  \n \n  \"Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth we\nbludgeoned aboard the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  ,\" he sighed. \"Soon will I be forced\ninto retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as I\nwill rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-daily\nfeedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is no\npleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismal\noutlook for one's next thousand years!\"\n  \n \n  \"You two carry on to the police station,\" said Retief. \"I want to play\na hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.\"\n  \n \n  \"What—?\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"As you wish, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumped\ndown, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stood\nvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.\n  \n \n  \"That's the trouble with a peaceful world,\" Retief muttered. \"No police\nprotection.\" He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a\nposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring\nblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed\nwrong....\n  \n \n  There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.\n  \n \n  Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had\nreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A\nsmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headed\noff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite side\nof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing\nGroaci.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Yith,\" he said, \"how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Release me, Retief!\" the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat\nbladder pulsating in agitation. \"The behemoths vie for the privilege of\ndismembering me out of hand!\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.\"\n  \n \n  \"I appeal to you,\" Yith whispered hoarsely. \"As a fellow diplomat, a\nfellow alien, a fellow soft-back—\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk?\" said Retief. \"Now\nkeep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.\"\n  \n \n  The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to the\nground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was\non its back, helpless.\n  \n \n  \"That's Whonk, still on his feet,\" said Retief. \"I wonder who he's\ncaught—and why.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk came toward the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  dragging the supine Fustian, who\nkicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind the\nsentry box. \"Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I can\noutrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.\" He stepped out and\nhailed Whonk.\n  \n \n  Puffing like a steam engine Whonk pulled up before him. \"Sleep,\nRetief!\" He panted. \"You followed a hunch; I did the same. I saw\nsomething strange in this one when we passed him on the avenue. I\nwatched, followed him here. Look! It is Slock, strapped into a dead\ncarapace! Now many things become clear.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_6]\nA stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned\nthe tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the\ngiant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered\na hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the\nair: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.\n  \n \n  Retief slid into his place beside Magnan. \"Sorry to be late, Mr.\nAmbassador.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,\" said Magnan coldly. He\nturned back to the Fustian on his left.\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,\" he said. \"Charming, most charming. So joyous.\"\n  \n \n  The Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. \"It is the\n   \n   Lament of\nHatching\n   \n  ,\" he said; \"our National Dirge.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\" said Magnan. \"How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of\ninstruments—\"\n  \n \n  \"It is a droon solo,\" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial\nAmbassador suspiciously.\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,\" Retief whispered loudly.\n\"And if I may interrupt a moment—\"\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,\nperhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.\"\n  \n \n  \"This group,\" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, \"the SCARS. How much\ndo you know about them, Mr. Minister?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing at all,\" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. \"For my taste, all\nYouths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a\ncarapace to tame their irresponsibility.\"\n  \n \n  \"We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful\nenergies,\" said Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"Labor gangs,\" said the minister. \"In my youth we were indentured to\nthe dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But in these modern times,\" put in Magnan, \"surely it's incumbent on\nus to make happy these golden hours.\"\n  \n \n  The minister snorted. \"Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me\nand pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,\"\ncried Magnan. \"Their essential tenderness—\"\n  \n \n  \"You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,\" the minister\nsaid, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, \"if you drilled\nboreholes and blasted.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_5]\nThe door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n  \n \n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n  \n \n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n  \n \n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n  \n \n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n  \n \n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n  \n \n  \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n  \n \n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n  \n \n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me—in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n  \n \n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n  \n \n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n  \n \n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n  \n \n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\n   \n   Moss\nRock\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it—a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n  \n \n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy—fast.\"\n  \n \n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n  \n \n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n  \n \n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n  \n \n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n  \n \n  The youth gurgled.\n  \n \n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n  \n \n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n  \n \n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian—\n  \n \n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought—\"\n  \n \n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n  \n \n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n  \n \n  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n  \n \n  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n  \n \n  \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_4]\nThe second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the\nEmbassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He\nflipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:\n  \n \n  \"Retief—I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first\ndark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive\nSponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,\narrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your\nintransigence.\"\n  \n \n  Retief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just\ntime to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep\nback.\n  \n \n  Outside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner\nand watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.\nThe nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun\nand the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.\n  \n \n  Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he\nwould be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but\nthe thought failed to keep the chill off.\n  \n \n  Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward\nRetief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.\n  \n \n  \"That's close enough, kids,\" he said. \"Plenty of room on this scow. No\nneed to crowd up.\"\n  \n \n  \"There are certain films,\" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was\nunusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved\nawkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.\n  \n \n  \"I told you once,\" said Retief. \"Don't crowd me.\"\n  \n \n  The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a\nfoot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw\nhis weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell\nheavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other\nYouth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.\nThe Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another\nvehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,\ntiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.\n  \n \n  So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\n  \n \n  And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\n  \n \n  But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer—and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\n  \n \n  At least not willingly....\n  \n \n  Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_2]\nMagnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shuddered. \"Please—never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\n  \n \n  Retief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters—such as working with\nYouth groups—would create a far better impression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust.

A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped.

He is initially unnamed, referred to as a \"gnarled ancient.\" He becomes a key ally to the protagonist, Retief, after Retief rescues him from an attack by a youth gang. Upon being rescued, he formally introduces himself.\n\n**Step 2: Forming an Alliance with Retief**\nAfter the youth gang, led by Slock, attacks the old Fustian for showing Retief the secret ship plans, Retief finds him tied up in a warehouse. Retief frees him, and the grateful Fustian introduces himself as Whonk, cementing their partnership. His gratitude is expressed in a traditional Fustian manner.\n##begin_quote##\n\"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 3: Whonk's Relevance to the Political Plot**\nWhonk's relevance to the narrative is multi-faceted. He serves as a crucial informant, a physical ally, and a representative of the older Fustian generation being victimized by the political machinations. He provides Retief with the critical information about suspicious cargo belonging to the Groaci, which Retief identifies as a powerful explosive intended for a political assassination.\n##begin_quote##\n\"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite small, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the Groaci. They lay here a day and a night.\"\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 4: Whonk's Role in the Climax**\nWhonk's role evolves from a simple clerk to Retief's primary muscle and enforcer. His immense strength and desire for vengeance against Slock are instrumental in foiling the plot. During the sponsorship ceremony, when Retief exposes Slock, Whonk is there to physically restrain the powerful Fustian youth leader, preventing his escape and validating Retief's accusations in front of the press and political figures.\n##begin_quote##\nWith a bellow Slock reached for Retief—and choked off in mid-cry as the Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear of the floor.\n##end_quote##\nHis actions directly expose the \"youth movement\" as a front for a violent political takeover orchestrated by the Groaci, bringing the central conflict to a head.\n\n##Answer: Whonk is an elderly Fustian who works as a clerk at the shipyards. He becomes Retief's key ally after Retief rescues him from Slock's gang. Whonk is relevant to the narrative as he provides crucial intelligence about the Groaci's plot, including the presence of explosives.

He meets Retief when Retief comes to to inquire about seeing plans for the new passenger liner. Whonk is neutral and correct, but not especially friendly. His partnership, and it seems fair to say, friendship with Retief really begins when Retief returns to the shipyard to look for Whonk and finds that the Fustian thugs who tried and failed to kill him, due to his thick, mature skin and shell, have left him tied up, in an undignified position on his back.\nRetief apologizes for putting him in danger, and gets the old Fustian back on his feet. Whonk is so grateful that he tells Retief, “My cows are yours,” a heartfelt, traditional Fustian expression of gratitude. \nWhonk is extremely angry about what the Fustian Slock and his gang have done to him, and throws in his lot with Retief. Thereafter, every time Retief is in physical danger from Fustians, Whonk is right there to help. \nAt the end of the story, Whonk steps in again to help Retief capture Yith, a member of the Groaci diplomatic mission, and Slock the rebel adult Fustian with no carapace. His desire for vengeance against these two nearly overwhelms his good sense. He puts Slock on the Moss Rose with the titanite that Slock had intended to use against Fustian politicians, and sets the rocket to blast off to Groaci, knowing that it would below up before it got there. \nBut Retief manages to settle him down enough not to take Yith apart piece by piece, by getting the Groaci to do something that would make Whonk’s life a lot easier and more pleasant: surgically remove his carapace. \nWhonk is steadfast, reliable, implacable – a good sidekick for Retief.\n", "Whonk is the older Fustian who helps Retief uncover the Groacian plot. He is looking after papers when Retief asks to see the plans of the new ship being built, but is hurt by the gang members and Youths that come in after Retief leaves. He is still willing to help Retief after this, and the two of them work together to piece together their evidence. Being older means that Whonk has a very heavy shell that keeps him from moving quickly, but he is very strong--he manages to capture a number of characters throughout the story to keep them from running away. Not only is Whonk the reason Retief was able to confirm that the new ship was indeed meant to be a battle cruiser, helping to uncover the plot, but the two of them become friends and go on a fishing trip together at the end of the story.", "Whonk is an elderly Fustian who works managing documents at the shipyard where Retief goes to investigate the new passenger ship being built there. Whonk shares the documents with Retief, who notices its similarities to a defunct ship design that had been previously used in combat. Whonk educates Retief on the rebellious ways of the younger Fustians before they witness a Groaci military attache consulting with some youth outside his office. The youth attack Whonk after Retief’s departure, nearly severing his head. When Retief returns to help him, Whonk is very grateful and continues to help Retief on his mission to discover the real connection between the Groaci and SCARS. Whonk guides Retief to the “Moss Rock” and helps Retief defeat yet another group of attacking youth. Whonk discovers that one of the youths is not a youth at all but rather an older Fustian with a detached shell. He is baffled by this. After a fracas at the sponsorship ceremony, Retief captures the Groaci attaché, and Whonk apprehends Slock, whom he quickly discovers is also an older Fustian with a surgically-removed shell. Retief convinces Whonk to forego his act of vengeance on the Groaci, and in exchange the Groaci would provide the elders of Fust with the same surgical procedure provided to the SCARS members. Pleased with this arrangement, Whonk agrees, but he is still seeking vengeance. He places Slock aboard the “Moss Rock” and sends it on a path to Groaci. The ship explodes on the way, killing Slock, and sending a message to the Groaci to stay away from Fust.", "Whonk is an older Fustian who is very polite and helpful to Retief. He lets Retief look at the blueprints for the passenger ship that the younger Fustians are building with the Groacis and then apologizes for the rudeness of the younger Fustian who confronts Retief for looking at the plans. Whonk becomes Retief’s ally right away; he holds off the younger Fustians who come back to confront Retief, giving Retief a chance to sneak out the back door. After two younger Fustians tell Retief they want his films from his pictures of the plans, he realizes they must have gotten the information about the pictures from Whonk and knew Whonk wouldn’t have given it to them freely. When he checks on Whonk, he finds him tied up. The younger Fustians had tried to kill him. From then on, the two work together, checking the Moss Rock for explosives that have been removed from the storage area. When attackers come, Whonk protects Retief and blocks the attackers with his carapace. Whonk provides Retief with information that he needs to determine who is involved in criminal activity and what that criminal activity is. At the end of the story, he provides justice for Slock by putting him aboard the Moss Rock before it blows up so that he gets his just rewards. When everything settles, Whonk offers to take Retief on a fishing vacation."]}}

Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.\nThey were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,\nafter running a copy for the reference files.\n  \n \n  And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV\nbattle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval\nArm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The\nterm \"obsolete\" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in\nthe armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in\nthe Eastern Arm.\n  \n \n  But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present\nbut himself and the old-timer—and he was willing to bet the elderly\nFustian hadn't told them anything.\n  \n \n  At least not willingly....\n  \n \n  Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the\nflat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the\nshipyard.\n\n[Chapter: THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_11]\nThe ceaseless voyaging began again.\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  voyaged to every\nocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After\na while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin\ncame to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell\napart as the different oceans.\n  \n \n \n \n  All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in\nhis life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only\nthe young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust\ntheir elders.\n  \n \n  As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest\nin the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port\nfor fuel or supplies—it was more economical to purchase them in that\nera than to have them shipped from the future—he seldom went ashore,\nand then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see\nthe sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea—and\nsometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes\nthat his other work lacked.\n  \n \n  When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit\nsomewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,\nhe could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this\njourney. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was\npurpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the\ncousin's utter disgust.\n  \n \n  \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you\ndo,\" the cousin—who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were\nscraping bottom now—advised.\n  \n \n  Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be\ndisillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither\npurpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.\nHowever, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives\nand felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked\nthe current cousin—who was passing as his nephew by now.\n  \n \n  The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's\na very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time—waiting\nuntil we're off guard. And then—pow!—he'll attack!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating\nmember of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would\never have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one\nconversation, anyhow.\n  \n \n  \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching\nhis ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n  \n \n  Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I\nhave every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had\ngiven up carrying a gun long ago.\n  \n \n  There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid\nout in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel\nand man and will—to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long\ntime.\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of\npassengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She\nbore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_3]\nThe youth hesitated. \"It is not a secret project,\" he muttered. \"Why\nshould it be secret?\"\n  \n \n  \"You tell me.\"\n  \n \n  The youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the\nFusty gesture of uncertainty. \"There is nothing to conceal,\" he said.\n\"We merely construct a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,\" said Retief. \"Who\nknows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.\"\n  \n \n  The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. \"Went\nfor his big brother, I guess,\" he said. \"I have a feeling I won't get\nto study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Willingly, light-footed one,\" said the old Fustian. \"And mine is the\nshame for the discourtesy of youth.\"\n  \n \n  Retief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed\nthrough the drawings, clicking the shutter.\n  \n \n  \"A plague on these youths,\" said the oldster, \"who grow more virulent\nday by day.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you elders clamp down?\"\n  \n \n  \"Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.\nUnknown in my youth was such insolence.\"\n  \n \n  \"The police—\"\n  \n \n  \"Bah!\" the ancient rumbled. \"None have we worthy of the name, nor have\nwe needed ought ere now.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's behind it?\"\n  \n \n  \"They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot\nmischief.\" He pointed to the window. \"They come, and a Soft One with\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured\nGroaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed\nthe hut, then started toward it.\n  \n \n  \"That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,\" Retief said. \"I\nwonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?\"\n  \n \n  \"Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,\" the oldster rumbled.\n\"Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.\"\n  \n \n  \"I was just leaving,\" Retief said. \"Which way out?\"\n  \n \n  \"The rear door,\" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. \"Rest well,\nstranger on these shores.\" He moved to the entrance.\n  \n \n  \"Same to you, pop,\" said Retief. \"And thanks.\"\n  \n \n  He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were\nraised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_5]\nThe door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.\nRetief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old\nfellow had put up a struggle.\n  \n \n  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief\nfollowed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of\na warehouse.\n  \n \n  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the\nworkmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in\ntheir siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various\nfittings in the lock. It snicked open.\n  \n \n  He eased the door aside far enough to enter.\n  \n \n  Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle\nof the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed\nout of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor\nbefore it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over\ninto a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged\nFustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.\n  \n \n  Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine\nand pulled the sack free.\n  \n \n  \"It's me, old fellow,\" Retief said. \"The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you\ninto this.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell\nback. \"A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,\" he\nrumbled. \"But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,\nSlock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.\"\n  \n \n  \"How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,\" said the old Fustian. \"It\nwould be your life.\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt if they'd go that far.\"\n  \n \n  \"Would they not?\" The Fustian stretched his neck. \"Cast your light\nhere. But for the toughness of my hide....\"\n  \n \n  Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of\nthick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a\nsound like a seal coughing.\n  \n \n  \"Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me—in vain. Then\nthey trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons\nto complete the task.\"\n  \n \n  \"Weapons? I thought it was illegal!\"\n  \n \n  \"Their evil genius, the Soft One,\" said the Fustian. \"He would provide\nfuel to the Devil himself.\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci again,\" said Retief. \"I wonder what their angle is.\"\n  \n \n  \"And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full\nintentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the\nblock and tackle.\"\n  \n \n  Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it\ninto position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.\nThe immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.\n  \n \n  Slowly he got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"My name is Whonk, fleet one,\" he said. \"My cows are yours.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right\nnow, let's get out of here.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,\nbulldozed them aside. \"Slow am I to anger,\" he said, \"but implacable in\nmy wrath. Slock, beware!\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold it,\" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. \"What's that odor?\" He\nflashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He\nknelt, sniffed at the spot.\n  \n \n  \"What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?\"\n  \n \n  Whonk considered. \"There were drums,\" he said. \"Four of them, quite\nsmall, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the\nGroaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first\nperiod they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge\n   \n   Moss\nRock\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  \"The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements\nafter I have settled a score with certain Youths.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I\nknow of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the\nfloor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium\npile.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the\nsentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the\nofficial luxury space barge\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  \"A sign of the times,\" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.\n\"A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away\nto sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go aboard and take a look around.\"\n  \n \n  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box\nstood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it—a discordant note\nin the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" he said. \"What means this?\" He held up a stained cloak of\norange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.\n  \n \n  \"Orange and green,\" mused Relief. \"Whose colors are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"I know not.\" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. \"But this is lettered.\" He\npassed the metal band to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"SCARS,\" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. \"It seems to me I've heard\nthe name before,\" he murmured. \"Let's get back to the Embassy—fast.\"\n  \n \n  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck\nthe charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and\nfetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm\nembrace.\n  \n \n  \"Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?\"\n  \n \n  \"The lout hid there by the storage bin,\" rumbled Whonk. The captive\nyouth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.\n  \n \n  \"Hang onto him,\" said Retief. \"He looks like the biting kind.\"\n  \n \n  \"No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speak, witless grub,\" growled Whonk, \"lest I tweak you in twain.\"\n  \n \n  The youth gurgled.\n  \n \n  \"Better let up before you make a mess of him,\" said Retief. Whonk\nlifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump\nthat made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the\nelder, mouth snapping.\n  \n \n  \"This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the\nkilling,\" said Whonk. \"In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance\nwith me on the bus,\" Retief said. \"He gets around.\"\n  \n \n  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief\nplanted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the\nbare back of the Fustian—\n  \n \n  \"By the Great Egg!\" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried\nto rise. \"This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked at the scarred back. \"I thought he looked a little old.\nBut I thought—\"\n  \n \n  \"This is not possible,\" Whonk said wonderingly. \"The great nerve trunks\nare deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the\ncarapace and leave the patient living.\"\n  \n \n  \"It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us\nand get out of here. His folks may come home.\"\n  \n \n  \"Too late,\" said Whonk. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  Three youths came from behind the sheds.\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Retief said. \"It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.\nWhere's your pal?\" he said to the advancing trio. \"The sticky little\nbird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers\nholding the bag, I'll bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shelter behind me, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  \"Go get 'em, old-timer.\" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.\n\"I'll jump around and distract them.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.\nThey fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief\nwhirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed\nit against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on\nRetief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  as Whonk\ntook him in full charge.\n  \n \n  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian\non the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed\nhastily, seriously dented but still mobile.\n  \n \n  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. \"Tough heads these kids\nhave got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got\nanother errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,\nbut I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled\nfor a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is\nenough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.\"\n  \n \n  \"The plot is foiled,\" said Whonk. \"But what reason did they have?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about\nthis gambit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which of these is the leader?\" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth\nwith a horny toe. \"Arise, dreaming one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I\nknow where to find the boss.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_2]\nMagnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. \"I don't think\nyou'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,\" he\nsaid.\n  \n \n  \"I like the adult Fustians,\" said Retief. \"Too bad they have to lug\nhalf a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would\nhelp.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief,\" Magnan sputtered. \"I'm amazed that even you\nwould bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical\ncharacteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater\nthan mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,\nMr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise\nyou, for example, would be tripping over your beard.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shuddered. \"Please—never mention the idea to a Fustian.\"\n  \n \n  Retief stood. \"My own program for the day includes going over to the\ndockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the\nFustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your\npermission, Mr. Ambassador...?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan snorted. \"Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,\nRetief. More interest in substantive matters—such as working with\nYouth groups—would create a far better impression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea\nto find out a little more about them,\" said Retief. \"Who organizes\nthem? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the\nalignment of this SCARS organization?\"\n  \n \n  \"You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,\" Magnan said.\n\"Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a\ntwo-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but\nbusiness. But what has Fust got that they could use?\"\n  \n \n  \"You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,\" said Magnan.\n\"Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci\nare barely ahead of them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Barely,\" said Retief. \"Just over the line into crude atomics ... like\nfission bombs.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. \"What market exists\nfor such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your\nattention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying\nthe social patterns of the local youth.\"\n  \n \n  \"I've studied them,\" said Retief. \"And before I meet any of the local\nyouth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the\nchancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car\nand leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle\ntrundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.\n  \n \n  It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty\ndwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians\nlumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly\nwheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,\nshell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the\nflat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his\nback, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the\nshipyard gates, creaked to a halt.\n  \n \n  \"Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,\" he said in Fustian.\n\"Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.\"\n  \n \n  Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. \"You should take up\nprofessional racing,\" he said. \"Daredevil.\"\n  \n \n  He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.\nBoards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.\n  \n \n  A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace\npeered out at Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Long-may-you-sleep,\" said Retief. \"I'd like to take a look around, if\nyou don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new\nliner today.\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,\" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy\narm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.\n\"The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of\npapers.\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how you feel, old-timer,\" said Retief. \"That sounds like the\nstory of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the\nvessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.\"\n  \n \n  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out\na sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood\nsilently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....\n  \n \n  \"What does the naked-back here?\" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He\nturned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the\nopen door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I came to take a look at your new liner,\" said Retief.\n  \n \n  \"We need no prying foreigners here,\" the youth snapped. His eye fell on\nthe drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.\n  \n \n  \"Doddering hulk!\" he snapped at the ancient. \"May you toss in\nnightmares! Put by the plans!\"\n  \n \n  \"My mistake,\" Retief said. \"I didn't know this was a secret project.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_8]\nIn the street the blue sun, Alpha, peered like an arc light under a low\ncloud layer, casting flat shadows across the mud of the avenue. The\nthree mounted a passing flat-car. Whonk squatted, resting the weight of\nhis immense shell on the heavy plank flooring.\n  \n \n  \"Would that I too could lose this burden, as has the false youth we\nbludgeoned aboard the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  ,\" he sighed. \"Soon will I be forced\ninto retirement. Then a mere keeper of a place of papers such as I\nwill rate no more than a slab on the public strand, with once-daily\nfeedings. And even for a man of high position, retirement is no\npleasure. A slab in the Park of Monuments is little better. A dismal\noutlook for one's next thousand years!\"\n  \n \n  \"You two carry on to the police station,\" said Retief. \"I want to play\na hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.\"\n  \n \n  \"What—?\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"As you wish, Retief,\" said Whonk.\n  \n \n  The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumped\ndown, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stood\nvacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.\n  \n \n  \"That's the trouble with a peaceful world,\" Retief muttered. \"No police\nprotection.\" He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a\nposition behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring\nblue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed\nwrong....\n  \n \n  There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.\n  \n \n  Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had\nreappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A\nsmall figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the gate. Headed\noff by the battling titans, he turned and made for the opposite side\nof the shipyard. Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing\nGroaci.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Yith,\" he said, \"how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.\"\n  \n \n  \"Release me, Retief!\" the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat\nbladder pulsating in agitation. \"The behemoths vie for the privilege of\ndismembering me out of hand!\"\n  \n \n  \"I know how they feel. I'll see what I can do ... for a price.\"\n  \n \n  \"I appeal to you,\" Yith whispered hoarsely. \"As a fellow diplomat, a\nfellow alien, a fellow soft-back—\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you appeal to Slock, as a fellow skunk?\" said Retief. \"Now\nkeep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.\"\n  \n \n  The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to the\nground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was\non its back, helpless.\n  \n \n  \"That's Whonk, still on his feet,\" said Retief. \"I wonder who he's\ncaught—and why.\"\n  \n \n  Whonk came toward the\n   \n   Moss Rock\n   \n  dragging the supine Fustian, who\nkicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind the\nsentry box. \"Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I can\noutrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.\" He stepped out and\nhailed Whonk.\n  \n \n  Puffing like a steam engine Whonk pulled up before him. \"Sleep,\nRetief!\" He panted. \"You followed a hunch; I did the same. I saw\nsomething strange in this one when we passed him on the avenue. I\nwatched, followed him here. Look! It is Slock, strapped into a dead\ncarapace! Now many things become clear.\"\n\n[Chapter: AIDE_MEMOIRE_10]\n\"It was quite a bang,\" said Retief. \"But I guess you saw it, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"No, confound it,\" Magnan said. \"When I remonstrated with Hulk, or\nWhelk—\"\n  \n \n  \"Whonk.\"\n  \n \n  \"—the ruffian thrust me into an alley bound in my own cloak.

The native inhabitants of Fust are described as something similar to snapping turtles that walk on their hind legs, and much of the imagery used by Fustians when speaking revolves around themes of the sea and mud. Fust is a peaceful enough world that they don’t even really have much of a police force, despite the rowdy and rebellious behavior of Fustian youths. \nNot much is known about the physical characteristics of the planet, such as the proportion of sea and dry land. We know there must be oceans, because the warehouse where Wonk was tied up and left was full of bales of kelp, a sea product. The city of the story is also near a sea, whose breezes make it a bit cool at certain times of day.\nThe city where all the action takes place is an important city, perhaps the capitol. It is full of diplomatic missions from all planets, and is apparently a place of some Fustian learning and culture, given that it has musicians for hire. There is a space ship building operation right outside the city, which can be reached by public transport that consists of flat open wagons. This is practical for the unwieldy shape of the adult Fustian, if not too comfortable for a human.\nOne of the most interesting things about Fust, and the hardest for an outsider to understand, is their assorted suns and moons. Fust is lit by a blue sun called Alpha and a yellow sun known as Beta, and three moons orbit Fust. There is also a third sun, unnamed, so that there are three “noons” on Fust.\n", "The story takes place on the planet whose native species is a turtle-like race known as the Fustians. It is usually a peaceful planet, and does not have a police force like humans are used to--in fact, weapons are currently illegal. There are at least two other species living here as well: the Terrestrials and the Groaci. More specifically, the story takes place near the coastline, with many events taking place either in political buildings or at the docks. The sea that lines this area has strong tides controlled by a number of celestial objects: there are three moons and multiple sons. The major sun is referred to as Beta, and is yellow, but there is a blue sun called Alpha as well. This has strong impacts on the weather as well: it can be very chilly while there are no suns in the sky, but very hot when the light is at its strongest. Besides the Terrestrial Embassy, its technical library, and the banquet hall, the protagonist Retief spends most of his time near the docks. At the port, he spends some time in the new ship being built where he asks Whonk to see the plans. He also does some investigation on the Moss Rock, the luxury ship where he found false evidence planted.", "The story takes place on the planet Fust, where a chancery houses the Terrestrial Embassy where Retief works. Fust has several suns and moons that regulate the tides of the ocean nearby. The Fustians regularly nap There is a large city surrounded by shipyards, where Retief conducts the majority of his investigation into the development of the new passenger barge. When Retief meets Whonk, they pore over blueprints for the barge in Whonk’s work hut and look out the window to see the Groaci attaché consulting with the Fustian youth that had harassed them earlier. Later, a pair of youth attack Retief at the bus station, and he returns to the shipyard to inquire after Whonk. He enters the warehouse behind Whonk’s shack and finds him injured in the midst of some hay bales. From there, Whonk and Retief go to the “Moss Rock”—a ship where the Groaci barrels filled with titanite had been taken earlier—to investigate. The “Moss Rock” is a luxurious ship dimly lit and meant for VIP guests. This is where Retief begins to uncover the plot of the Groaci to implicate SCARS in the ship’s destruction. Retief then attends the sponsorship ceremony, which is held in a banquet hall with a low-ceiling. Fustian music plays, which is inaudible to the human ear. After Slock escapes the ceremony, Retief goes back to the “Moss Rock”, and this is where Whonk ultimately apprehends Slock once more.", "The story's setting is in the future on a space world named Fust, inhabited by creatures who look similar to turtles. Fust has oceans or seas large enough for passenger ships and barges which provide fish for the Fustians. Aliens come to Fust; Magnan and Retief work at the Terrestrial Embassy; the Groacis also have members on Fust. The planet has two suns: Beta, which is yellow, and Alpha, which is blue. There are also three moons. Part of the action in the story takes place in the Terrestrial Embassy. In contrast, other parts occur in the shipyard where the passenger ship is being built, its warehouse where Whonk is hidden after he is beaten, and where the explosive had been stored, aboard the barge the Moss Rock where the explosive has been moved and where Whonk puts Slock at the end of the story, and a low-ceiling banquet hall where the dinner is being held.

Bettijean sighed noisily. Andy found his\ncigarette dead and lit another. He fancied a tiny lever in his brain\nand he shifted gears to direct his thinking back into the proper\nchannel. Abruptly his fatigue began to lift. He picked up the new pile\nof reports Bettijean had brought in.\n  \n \n  She move around the desk and sat, noting the phone book he had used,\nstudying the names he had crossed off. \"Did you learn anything?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  Andy coughed, trying to clear his raw throat. \"It's crazy,\" he said.\n\"From the Senate and House on down, I haven't found a single\ngovernment worker sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"I found a few,\" she said. \"Over in a Virginia hospital.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I did find,\" Andy said, flipping through pages of his own\nscrawl, \"a society matron and her social secretary, a whole flock of\noffice workers—business, not government—and new parents and newly\nengaged girls and....\" He shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice anything significant about those office workers?\"\n  \n \n  Andy nodded. \"I was going to ask you the same, since I was just\nguessing. I hadn't had time to check it out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I checked some. Practically none of my victims came from big\noffices, either business or industry. They were all out of one and\ntwo-girl offices or small businesses.\"\n  \n \n  \"That was my guess. And do you know that I didn't find a doctor,\ndentist or attorney?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nor a single postal worker.\"\n  \n \n  Andy tried to smile. \"One thing we do know. It's not a communicable\nthing. Thank heaven for—\"\n  \n \n  He broke off as a cute blonde entered and put stacks of reports before\nboth Andy and Bettijean. The girl hesitated, fidgeting, fingers to her\nteeth. Then, without speaking, she hurried out.\n  \n \n  Andy stared at the top sheet and groaned. \"This may be something. Half\nthe adult population of Aspen, Colorado, is down.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Bettijean frowned over the report in her hands. \"It's the same\nthing—only not quite as severe—in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\"\n  \n \n  \"Writers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mostly. Some artists, too, and musicians. And poets are among the\nhard hit.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is insane,\" Andy muttered. \"Doctors and dentists are\nfine—writers and poets are sick. Make sense out of that.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean held up a paper and managed a confused smile. \"Here's a\ncountry doctor in Tennessee. He doesn't even know what it's all about.\nNobody's sick in his valley.\"\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in our outer office is organized,\" Andy said, pulling at his\ncigarette. \"Here're reports from a dozen military installations all\nlumped together.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does it show?\"\n  \n \n  \"Black-out. By order of somebody higher up—no medical releases. Must\nmean they've got it.\" He scratched the growing stubble on his chin.\n\"If this were a fifth column setup, wouldn't the armed forces be the\nfirst hit?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" Bettijean brightened, then sobered. \"Maybe not. The brass\ncould keep it secret if an epidemic hit an army camp. And they could\nslap a control condition on any military area. But the panic will come\nfrom the general public.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here's another batch,\" Andy said. \"Small college towns under\ntwenty-five thousand population. All hard hit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, it's not split intellectually. Small colleges and small offices\nand writers get it. Doctors don't and dentists don't. But we can't\ntell who's got it on the military bases.\"\n  \n \n  \"And it's not geographical. Look, remember those two reports from\nTennessee? That place where they voted on water bonds or something,\neverybody had it. But the country doctor in another section hadn't\neven heard of it.\" Andy could only shake his head.\n  \n \n  Bettijean heaved herself up from the chair and trudged back to the\nouter office. She returned momentarily with a tray of food. Putting a\npaper cup of coffee and a sandwich in front of Andy, she sat down and\nnibbled at her snack like an exhausted chipmunk.\n  \n \n  Andy banged a fist at his desk again. Coffee splashed over the rim of\nhis cup onto the clutter of papers. \"It's here,\" he said angrily.\n\"It's here somewhere, but we can't find it.\"\n  \n \n  \"The answer?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course. What is it that girls in small offices do or eat or drink\nor wear that girls in large offices don't do or eat or drink or wear?\nWhat do writers and doctors do differently? Or poets and dentists?\nWhat are we missing? What—\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_8]\nThe general wheeled to fire a salvo of commands. Officers poured into\nthe corridor. Only the brigadier remained, a puzzled frown crinkling\nhis granite brow.\n  \n \n  \"But you said that postal workers weren't getting sick.\"\n  \n \n  Andy chucked. \"That's right. Did you ever see a post office clerk\nlick a stamp? They always use a sponge.\"\n  \n \n  The general looked to Bettijean, to Andy, to the stamp. He grinned and\nthe grin became a rumbling laugh. \"How would you two like a thirty-day\nfurlough to rest up—or to get better acquainted?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean squealed. Andy reached for her hand.\n  \n \n  \"And while you're gone,\" the general continued, \"I'll see what strings\nI can pull. If I can't wangle you a couple of battlefield commissions,\nI'll zip you both through O.C.S. so fast you won't even have time to\npin on the bars.\"\n  \n \n  But neither Andy nor Bettijean had heard a word after the mention of\nfurlough. Like a pair of puppy-lovers, they were sinking into the\ndepths of each other's eyes.\n  \n \n  And the general was still chuckling as he picked up the lone four-cent\nstamp in his left hand, made a gun of his right hand, and marched the\nstamp out of the office under guard.\n  \n \n  THE END\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_3]\nIt was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n  \n \n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto—\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n  \n \n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and—\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man—\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't—\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from—\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_1]\nTHE PLAGUE\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  By TEDDY KELLER\n  \n \n \n \n \n   Suppose a strictly one hundred per cent American plague\nshowed up.... One that attacked only people within the\npolitical borders of the United States!\n   \n \n \n \n \n  Illustrated by Schoenherr\n  \n \n \n  Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud ignored the jangling telephones and the\nexcited jabber of a room full of brass, and lit a cigarette. Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n  \n \n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line—in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause—by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n  \n \n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n  \n \n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe\nthis replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the\nbrand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in\ncharge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious\nepidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack\ntimed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top\nof the whole powder keg.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment\nbefore he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop\nof hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\"\nhe said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I\nknow what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority,\nwe'll try to figure this thing out.\"\n  \n \n  \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so\nirregular. A noncom!\" He said it like a dirty word.\n  \n \n  \"Irregular, hell,\" the brigadier snorted, the message getting through.\n\"There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the\nsergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other\nofficers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n  \n \n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_2]\nBettijean crossed briskly to his desk. She gave him a motherly smile\nas she put down a thick sheaf of papers. \"You look beat,\" she said.\n\"Brass give you much trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not much. We're top priority now.\" He ran fingers through the thick,\nbrown hair and massaged his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to\nhis wary and confused brain. \"What's new?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've gone though some of these,\" she said. \"Tried to save you a\nlittle time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. Sit down.\"\n  \n \n  She pulled up a chair and thumbed through the papers. \"So far, no\nfatalities. That's why there's no panic yet, I guess. But it's\nspreading like ... well, like a plague.\" Fear flickered deep in her\ndark eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Any water reports?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"Wichita O.K., Indianapolis O.K., Tulsa O.K., Buffalo O.K.,—and a\nbunch more. No indication there. Except\"—she fished out a one-page\nreport—\"some little town in Tennessee. Yesterday there was a campaign\nfor everybody to write their congressman about some deal and today\nthey were to vote on a new water system. Hardly anybody showed up at\nthe polls. They've all got it.\"\n  \n \n  Andy shrugged. \"You can drink water, but don't vote for it. Oh, that's\na big help.\" He rummaged through the clutter on his desk and came up\nwith a crude chart. \"Any trends yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's hitting everybody,\" Bettijean said helplessly. \"Not many kids so\nfar, thank heavens. But housewives, businessmen, office workers,\nteachers, preachers—rich, poor—from Florida to Alaska. Just when you\ncalled me in, one of the girls thought she had a trend. The isolated\nmountain areas of the West and South. But reports are too\nfragmentary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\" he cried suddenly, banging the desk. \"People deathly\nill, but nobody dying. And doctors can't identify the poison until\nthey have a fatality for an autopsy. People stricken in every part of\nthe country, but the water systems are pure. How does it spread?\"\n  \n \n  \"In food?\"\n  \n \n  \"How? There must be hundreds of canneries and dairies and packing\nplants over the country. How could they all goof at the same\ntime—even if it was sabotage?\"\n  \n \n  \"On the wind?\"\n  \n \n  \"But who could accurately predict every wind over the entire\ncountry—even Alaska and Hawaii—without hitting Canada or Mexico? And\nwhy wouldn't everybody get it in a given area?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean's smooth brow furrowed and she reached across the desk to\ngrip his icy, sweating hands. \"Andy, do ... do you think it's ...\nwell, an enemy?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I just don't know.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment he sat there, trying to draw strength from her,\npunishing his brain for the glimmer of an idea. Finally, shaking his\nhead, he pushed back into his chair and reached for the sheaf of\npapers.\n  \n \n  \"We've got to find a clue—a trend—an inkling of something.\" He\nnodded toward the outer office. \"Stop all in-coming calls. Get those\ngirls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country.\nHave them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up\nanother relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and\nsandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and\noccupation of the victims. You and I'll start with Washington.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode\nfrom the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on\nthe phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone\nand directory.\n  \n \n  He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to\nworried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical\nnurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible\nscrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned\ndown to a rasping whisper. But columns climbed up his rough chart and\nbroken lines pointed vaguely to trends.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_6]\nIn the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did—everything you ate or drank—in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ...

Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no.

Now you just take it\neasy and—. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers—Aspen, Taos and college towns—thousands of\npeople sick—but none in that valley in Tennessee—and few government\nworkers—just one girl in his office—and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter—and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n\n[Chapter: THE_SERPENT_RIVER_5]\nclass=\"chap\"/> 3. They were waving short clubs or whips with stones tied to the ends. They charged up the slope, about sixty yards, swinging their weird clubs with a threat of death. Wild disorder suddenly struck the audience. Campbell and I believed we were about to witness a massacre. \"Captain— Jim ! You're not going to let this happen!\" Our sympathies had gone to the first groups, the peaceable ones. I had the same impulse as Campbell—to do something—anything! Yet here we sat in our ship, more than half a mile from our thirty-five or forty \"friends\" in danger. Our friends were panicked. But they didn't take flight. They didn't duck for the holes in the rocky hilltop. Instead, they rallied and packed themselves around their tall leader. They stood, a defiant wall. \"Can we shoot a ray, Jim?\" I didn't answer. Later I would recall that Split could drop his dignity under excitement—his \"Captain Linden\" and \"sir.\" Just now he wanted any sort of split-second order. We saw the naked warriors run out in a wide circle. They spun and weaved, they twirled their deadly clubs, they danced grotesquely. They were closing in. Closer and closer. It was all their party. \"Jim, can we shoot?\" \"Hit number sixteen, Campbell.\" Split touched the number sixteen signal. The ship's siren wailed out over the land. You could tell when the sound struck them. The circle of savage ones suddenly fell apart. The dancing broke into the wildest contortions you ever saw. As if they'd been spanked by a wave of electricity. The siren scream must have sounded like an animal cry from an unknown world. The attackers ran for the sponge-trees. The rootless jungle came to life. It jerked and jumped spasmodically down the slope. And our siren kept right on singing. \"Ready for that hike, Campbell? Give me my equipment coat.\" I got into it. I looked back to the telescope. The tall man of the party had behaved with exceptional calmness. He had turned to stare in our direction from the instant the siren sounded. He could no doubt make out the lines of our silvery ship in the shadows. Slowly, deliberately, he marched over the hilltop toward us. Most of his party now scampered back to the safety of their hiding places in the ground. But a few—the brave ones, perhaps, or the officials of his group—came with him. \"He needs a stronger guard than that,\" Campbell grumbled. Sixteen was still wailing. \"Set it for ten minutes and come on,\" I said. Together we descended from the ship. We took into our nostrils the tangy air, breathing fiercely, at first. We slogged along over the rock surface feeling our weight to be one-and-a-third times normal. We glanced down the slope apprehensively. We didn't want any footraces. The trees, however, were still retreating. Our siren would sing on for another eight minutes. And in case of further danger, we were equipped with the standard pocket arsenal of special purpose capsule bombs. Soon we came face to face with the tall, stately old leader in the cream-and-red cloak. Split and I stood together, close enough to exchange comments against the siren's wail. Fine looking people, we observed. Smooth faces. Like the features of Earth men. These creatures could walk down any main street back home. With a bit of makeup they would pass. \"Notice, Captain, they have strange looking eyes.\" \"Very smooth.\" \"It's because they have no eyebrows ... no eye lashes.\" \"Very smooth—handsome—attractive.\" Then the siren went off. The leader stood before me, apparently unafraid. He seemed to be waiting for me to explain my presence. His group of twelve gathered in close. I had met such situations with ease before. \"EGGWE\" explorers come equipped. I held out a gift toward the leader. It was a singing medallion attached to a chain. It was disc-shaped, patterned after a large silver coin. It made music at the touch of a button. In clear, dainty bell tones it rang out its one tune, \"Trail of Stars.\" As it played I held it up for inspection. I placed it around my own neck, then offered it to the leader. I thought he was smiling. He was not overwhelmed by the \"magic\" of this gadget. He saw it for what it was, a token of friendship. There was a keenness about him that I liked. Yes, he was smiling. He bent his head forward and allowed me to place the gift around his neck. \"Tomboldo,\" he said, pointing to himself. Split and I tried to imitate his breathy accents as we repeated aloud, \"Tomboldo.\" We pointed to ourselves, in turn, and spoke our own names. And then, as the names of the others were pronounced, we tried to memorize each breathy sound that was uttered. I was able to remember four or five of them. One was Gravgak. Gravgak's piercing eyes caused me to notice him. Suspicious eyes? I did not know these people's expressions well enough to be sure. Gravgak was a guard, tall and muscular, whose arms and legs were painted with green and black diamond designs. By motions and words we didn't understand, we inferred that we were invited to accompany the party back home, inside the hill, where we would be safe. I nodded to Campbell. \"It's our chance to be guests of Tomboldo.\" Nothing could have pleased us more. For our big purpose—to understand the Serpent River—would be forwarded greatly if we could learn, through the people, what its meanings were. To analyze the river's substance, estimate its rate, its weight, its temperature, and to map its course—these facts were only a part of the information we sought. The fuller story would be to learn how the inhabitants of this planet regarded it: whether they loved or shunned it, and what legends they may have woven around it. All this knowledge would be useful when future expeditions of men from the Earth followed us (through EGGWE) for an extension of peaceful trade relationships. Tomboldo depended upon the guard Gravgak to make sure that the way was safe. Gravgak was supposed to keep an eye on the line of floating trees that had taken flight down the hillside. Danger still lurked there, we knew. And now the siren that had frightened off the attack was silent. Our ship, locked against invaders, could be forgotten. We were guests of Tomboldo. Gravgak was our guard, but he didn't work at it. He was too anxious to hear all the talk. In the excitement of our meeting, everyone ignored the growing darkness, the lurking dangers. Gravgak confronted us with agitated jabbering: \"Wollo—yeeta—vo—vandartch—vandartch! Grr—see—o—see—o—see—o!\" \"See—o—see—o—see—o,\" one of the others echoed. It began to make sense. They wanted us to repeat the siren noises. The enemy had threatened their lives. There could very well have been a wholesale slaughter. But as long as we could make the \"see—o—see—o\" we were all safe. Split and I exchanged glances. He touched his hand to the equipment jacket, to remind me we were armed with something more miraculous than a yowling siren. \"See—o—see—o—see—o!\" Others of Tomboldo's party echoed the demand. They must have seen the sponge-trees again moving toward our path. \" See—o—see—o! \" Our peaceful march turned into a spasm of terror. The sponge-trees came rushing up the slope, as if borne by a sudden gust of wind. They bounced over our path, and the war party spilled out of them. Shouting. A wild swinging of clubs. And no cat-and-mouse tricks. No deliberate circling and closing in. An outright attack. Naked bodies gleaming in the semi-darkness. Arms swinging weapons, choosing the nearest victims. The luminous rocks on the ends of the clubs flashed. Shouting, screeching, hurling their clubs. The whizzing fury filled the air. I hurled a capsule bomb. It struck at the base of a bouncing sponge-tree, and blew the thing to bits. The attackers ran back into a huddle, screaming. Then they came forward, rushing defiantly. Our muscular guard, Gravgak was too bold. He had picked up one of their clubs and he ran toward their advance, and to all of Tomboldo's party it must have appeared that he was bravely rushing to his death. Yet the gesture of the club he swung so wildly could have been intended as a warning ! It could have meant, Run back, you fools, or these strange devils will throw fire at you. I threw fire. And so did my lieutenant. He didn't wait for orders, thank goodness. He knew it was their lives or ours. Zip, zip, zip—BLANG-BLANG-BLANG! The bursts of fire at their feet ripped the rocks. The spray caught them and knocked them back. Three or four warriors in the fore ranks were torn up in the blasts. Others were flattened—and those who were able, ran. They ran, not waiting for the cover of sponge-trees. Not bothering to pick up their clubs. But the operation was not a complete success. We had suffered a\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_4]\nAnd from the door, an icy voice said, \"Yes, colonel?\"\n  \n \n  The colonel and his captains wheeled, stared and saluted. \"Oh,\ngeneral,\" the colonel said. \"I was just—\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" the brigadier said, stepping into the room. \"I've been\nlistening to you. And I thought I suggested that everybody leave the\nsergeant and his staff alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general, I—\"\n  \n \n  The general showed the colonel his back and motioned Andy into his\nchair. He glanced to Bettijean and a smile warmed his wedge face.\n\"Corporal, were you speaking just then as a woman or as a soldier?\"\n  \n \n  Crimson erupted into Bettijean's face and her tight laugh said many\nthings. She shrugged. \"Both I guess.\"\n  \n \n  The general waved her to a chair and, oblivious of the colonel, pulled\nup a chair for himself. The last trace of humor drained from his face\nas he leaned elbows on the desk. \"Andy, this is even worse than we had\nfeared.\"\n  \n \n  Andy fumbled for a cigarette and Bettijean passed him a match. A\ncaptain opened his mouth to speak, but the colonel shushed him.\n  \n \n  \"I've just come from Intelligence,\" the general said. \"We haven't had\na report—nothing from our agents, from the Diplomatic Corps, from the\ncivilian newspapermen—not a word from any Iron Curtain country for a\nday and half. Everybody's frantic. The last item we had—it was a\ncoded message the Reds'd tried to censor—was an indication of\nsomething big in the works.\"\n  \n \n  \"A day and half ago,\" Andy mused. \"Just about the time we knew we had\nan epidemic. And about the time they knew it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It could be just propaganda,\" Bettijean said hopefully, \"proving that\nthey could cripple us from within.\"\n  \n \n  The general nodded. \"Or it could be the softening up for an all-out\neffort. Every American base in the world is alerted and every\nserviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've\nstill got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're\nright ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?\"\n  \n \n  Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through\nmuffled. \"I can sit here and cry.\" For an eternity he sat there,\nfutility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm.\nHe heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement\nthat silenced him.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. \"We'll\nfind your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.\"\n  \n \n  The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then\nlaunched himself from the chair. Pivoting, he said, \"Colonel, you and\nyour captains will be stationed by that switchboard out there. For the\nduration of this emergency, you will take orders only from the\nsergeant and the corporal here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general,\" the colonel wailed, \"a noncom? I'm assigned—\"\n  \n \n  The general snorted. \"Insubordination cannot be tolerated—unless you\nfind a two-star general to outrank me. Now, as I said before, let's\nget out of here and let these people work.\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_7]\nIt was Bettijean who squeezed into the office and broke the brittle\nsilence. \"Andy, for heaven's sake, what is it?\" Then she moved around\nthe desk to stand behind him as he faced the officers.\n  \n \n  \"Have you got something?\" the brigadier asked. \"Some girl outside was\nbabbling about writers and doctors, and dentists and college students,\nand little secretaries and big secretaries. Have you established a\ntrend?\"\n  \n \n  Andy glanced at the lab report and his smile was as relieved as it was\nweary. \"Our problem,\" he said, \"was in figuring out what a writer does\nthat a doctor doesn't—why girls from small offices were sick—and why\nsenators and postal workers weren't—why college students caught the\nbug and people in a Tennessee community didn't.\n  \n \n  \"The lab report isn't complete. They haven't had time to isolate the\npoison and prescribe medication. But\"—he held up a four-cent\nstamp—\"here's the villain, gentlemen.\"\n  \n \n  The big brass stood stunned and shocked. Mouths flapped open and eyes\nbugged at Andy, at the stamp.\n  \n \n  Bettijean said, \"Sure. College kids and engaged girls and new parents\nand especially writers and artists and poets—they'd all lick lots of\nstamps. Professional men have secretaries. Big offices have\npostage-meter machines. And government offices have free franking.\nAnd\"—she threw her arms around the sergeant's neck—\"Andy, you're\nwonderful.\"\n  \n \n  \"The old American ingenuity,\" the colonel said, reaching for Andy's\nphone. \"I knew we could lick it. Now all we have to do—\"\n  \n \n  \"At ease, colonel,\" the brigadier said sharply. He waited until the\ncolonel had retreated, then addressed Andy. \"It's your show.

The story follows several government workers as they navigate a sudden and mysterious epidemic. Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud, mostly referred to as Andy, works at the Office of the Civil Health and Germ Welfare Protection located in the Pentagon. Corporal Bettijean Baker, his right-hand woman and new lover, picks up the phone one day, and then chaos ensues. \nA switchboard is put in the hallway to help receive the hundreds of calls being made to their office. This sudden influx of calls, attention, people, and disease leave the main characters feeling overwhelmed and desperate. \nSince the new lieutenant had not arrived (post Colonel Patterson’s retirement), Sergeant Andy is effectively in charge as a noncom, though not everyone is happy about that. Andy pushes their worries aside, and continues working. \nDespite the spread, no fatalities have been reported, and infections are random. No trend has been established yet, but they are searching desperately for one. Bettijean goes through reports with Sergeant Andy, revealing all she’s uncovered. It’s affecting workers, artists, and poets, but not necessarily those who work in government, or as doctors or businessmen. The water systems are ruled out, as well as wind and food. Bettijean and Andy are left with nothing, except the possibility of biological terrorism. \nFinally, Andy orders Bettijean to halt all in-coming calls, and redirect their attention to all hospitals. \nDespite their best efforts, no conclusion can be reached. The colonel reappears in Andy’s office, followed by two officers. He throws a newspaper down on his desk, proclaiming that this epidemic was allegedly caused by the Russians, and that all the authorities are baffled. It is hinted that the Colonel commissioned this article to throw doubt on Andy’s authority. Andy defends his employees and the work they’ve been doing. The Colonel forces Andy and Bettijean out of office, and Andy lets him, kissing Bettijean on the way out. Suddenly, the general walks in and gives Andy back his job, while telling him the news from Intelligence. The Iron Curtain’s not sent word for almost two days. Only a coded message that could have been about the epidemic. \nAndy promises to work hard again, and the general assigns the colonel and his two men to the switchboard in the hall. After brainstorming about potential causes, Janis, another employee, enters the room and puts another stack of reports down. Small college towns, newly engaged girls, poets, all these people have been infected. Janis falls to the floor, and everyone rushes to her. She’s been infected with the disease, and they question her about her activities for the past 12 hours. It’s revealed finally that she wrote a letter to her mother, and Andy finally figures it out. The poison was in the stamps. He lets his higher-ups know, and Janis is carted off to safety. Bettijean and Andy are given a 30-day vacation to relax and explore their relationship further. \n", "Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud has found himself in charge of the Office of Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection somewhat by accident. As he waits for a replacement, his superior officers nervously warn him about an epidemic that they don’t understand yet, that Andy will be in charge of the response for. Corporal Bettijean Baker is Andy’s assistant, in this previously under-the-radar department that is all of a sudden the most important aspect of the nation’s response. Andy and Bettijean work through reports together to look for a trend, hoping to find how the epidemic is spreading. It seems to be affecting only the United States of America, without affecting Canada even though it has reached Alaska. The dumbfounded officers decide to learn more about the people who have fallen sick. When Bettijean returned with more reports, two other officers came into Andy’s office to show him the headlines: the public panic had started, two days after the office had stopped sleeping to find the root of the issue. The colonel doesn’t appreciate the lack of military formality in the way that Andy and Bettijean are taking, and he angrily orders them to be disciplined before the general interrupts. The general gestures to Andy and Bettijean to continue their work, and sat down with them to talk solemnly. There’s some suspicion about the Soviet Union’s involvement. Recognizing Andy’s need for manpower, the general assigns the very unhappy colonel to report to Andy and Bettijean for as long as the epidemic is going on. Lighting a new cigarette, Andy gets back to work. The team found evidence of small business workers being sick, but no government workers (outside of some in a hospital), no doctors, and no postal workers. They take this as evidence that it’s not communicable, but they find some cities are more affected than others. Writers, poets, artists, and musicians in cities that are often vacation spots are hit hard, along with small college towns. They are interrupted by screams outside their door when Janis falls sick. When she’s able to talk, Andy asks Janis questions about the past twelve hours. She had written and mailed a letter to her mother about the epidemic, but nothing else seemed out of place. Andy pondered over another cigarette as the doctor saw to Janis. Andy suddenly had an idea, frantically searched for Janis’ purse, and handed one of her postage stamps to a lab technician. His hunch was right: the stamp was the problem, licking the glue was how people got sick. Andy starts on a plan to notify the public of the issue, and to investigate the source of the poison in the stamps. The lab was able to identify the toxin, and it would be simple to treat. The general took over giving orders, and gave Andy and Bettijean a month of furlough before marching the stamp out of the office as Andy and Bettijean looked at each other longingly.

Sergeant Major Andy McCloud and his Corporal Bettijean Baker slowly learns the details of the pandemic. It is entirely confined to the United States and seems to affect people according to no discernable pattern. The illness is not passed person to person and has affected people regardless of age, location, and behavior while other people are spared.\n\nHigh ranking military officials (the brass) express to Andy the urgency of the situation. As the day wears on, Andymust deal with threats to his operation from officers that believe that, as a noncommissioned officer, He is not qualified to perform his task regardless of his obvious expertise.\n\nVague trends begin to emerge. Large offices see no cases while small ones do; doctors and dentists are mostly unaffected while writers and poets are.\n\nEventually a woman working the phones in the Germ Warfare Protection division falls ill and Andy solves the riddle of the illness. Stamp adhesive is determined to be the vector for the illness. With the mystery solved, a plan to halt the spread of the illness is formulated and the brass gives Andy and Bettijean a vacation furlough and promise of a promotion.", "Sergeant Andrew McCloud is in charge of the office of Germ War Protection when a mysterious plague breaks out in the United States. His coworker Bettlejean tells him that all kinds of people are coming down with the illness, but no one has died yet. The strangest part about the new disease is that it has only affected Americans. Not even Canadians or Mexicans have become sick. \n\nMcCloud decides to send everyone who works in the office out to do some investigating about where the illness is coming from. He tells Bettlejean that the two of them will work in Washington. They begin to put together clues about the nature of the illness when suddenly a woman in the office, Janis, drops to the ground. She is red and feverish and extremely nervous. After some prodding, she admits that she broke an office rule when she mailed her mother a letter that included information about the outbreak. \n\nAfter a few moments of reflection, McCloud runs to Janis’s office and tears through her drawers to find her stamps. He sends the lab technician to test them, but he is already convinced that the stamps contain poison, and they are behind the mysterious illness. \n\nWhen his superior comes in to ask him what he has discovered, McCloud divulges his beliefs about the problematic stamps. McCloud suggests that the President make an announcement to the public about the poisonous stamps. However, he quickly realizes that the stamps could have been tainted accidentally, and this doesn’t necessarily point to an attack on the country. McCloud is interrupted by a phone call from the lab. The technician informs him that the illness the stamps cause has a quick fix, and the people who are ill are going to be just fine. McCloud allows someone else to take over. He’s too tired and elated to make any more decisions. \n\nThe general offers McCloud and Bettlejean many awards and some time off to get to know each other better.

There was a murmur from the crowd and he found his gaze riveted overhead. High above, in the misty blue sky, was a sudden twinkle of fire. He reached up and wiped his sweaty face with a muddy hand and brushed aside a straggly lock of tangled hair. It wouldn't hurt to try to look his best. The twinkling fire came nearer. II \"A Mr. Macdonald to see you, Mr. Escher.\" Claude Escher flipped the intercom switch. \"Please send him right in.\" That was entirely superfluous, he thought, because MacDonald would come in whether Escher wanted him to or not. The door opened and shut with a slightly harder bang than usual and Escher mentally braced himself. He had a good hunch what the problem was going to be and why it was being thrown in their laps. MacDonald made himself comfortable and sat there for a few minutes, just looking grim and not saying anything. Escher knew the psychology by heart. A short preliminary silence is always more effective in browbeating subordinates than an initial furious bluster. He lit a cigarette and tried to outwait MacDonald. It wasn't easy—MacDonald had great staying powers, which was probably why he was the head of the department. Escher gave in first. \"Okay, Mac, what's the trouble? What do we have tossed in our laps now?\" \"You know the one—colonization problem. You know that when we first started to colonize, quite a large percentage of the male population took to the stars, as the saying goes. The adventuresome, the gamblers, the frontier type all decided they wanted to head for other worlds, to get away from it all. The male of the species is far more adventuresome than the female; the men left—but the women didn't. At least, not in nearly the same large numbers. \"Well, you see the problem. The ratio of women to men here on Earth is now something like five to three. If you don't know what that means, ask any man with a daughter. Or any psychiatrist. Husband-hunting isn't just a pleasant pastime on Earth. It's an earnest cutthroat business and I'm not just using a literary phrase.\" He threw a paper on Escher's desk. \"You'll find most of the statistics about it in that, Claude. Notice the increase in crimes peculiar to women. Shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, that kind of thing. It's quite a list. You'll also notice the huge increase in petty crimes, a lot of which wouldn't have bothered the courts before. In fact, they wouldn't even have been considered crimes. You know why they are now?\" Escher shook his head blankly. \"Most of the girls in the past who didn't catch a husband,\" MacDonald continued, \"grew up to be the type of old maid who's dedicated to improving the morals and what-not of the rest of the population. We've got more puritanical societies now than we ever had, and we have more silly little laws on the books as a result. You can be thrown in the pokey for things like violating a woman's privacy—whatever that means—and she's the one who decides whether what you say or do is a violation or not.\" Escher looked bored. \"Not to mention the new prohibition which forbids the use of alcohol in everything from cough medicines to hair tonics. Or the cleaned up moral code that reeks—if you'll pardon the expression—of purity. Sure, I know what you mean. And you know the solution. All we have to do is get the women to colonize.\" MacDonald ran his fingers nervously through his hair. \"But it won't be easy, and that's why it's been given to us. It's your baby, Claude. Give it a lot of thought. Nothing's impossible, you know.\" \"Perpetual motion machines are,\" Escher said quietly. \"And pulling yourself up by your boot-straps. But I get the point. Nevertheless, women just don't want to colonize. And who can blame them? Why should they give up living in a luxury civilization, with as many modern conveniences as this one, to go homesteading on some wild, unexplored planet where they have to work their fingers to the bone and play footsie with wild animals and savages who would just as soon skin them alive as not?\" \"What do you advise I do, then?\" MacDonald demanded. \"Go back to the Board and tell them the problem is not solvable, that we can't think of anything?\" Escher looked hurt. \"Did I say that? I just said it wouldn't be easy.\" \"The Board is giving you a blank check. Do anything you think will pay off. We have to stay within the letter of the law, of course, but not necessarily the spirit.\" \"When do they have to have a solution?\" \"As soon as possible. At least within the year. By that time the situation will be very serious. The psychologists say that what will happen then won't be good.\" \"All right, by then we'll have the answer.\" MacDonald stopped at the door. \"There's another reason why they want it worked out. The number of men applying to the Colonization Board for emigration to the colony planets is falling off.\" \"How come?\" MacDonald smiled. \"On the basis of statistics alone, would you want to emigrate from a planet where the women outnumber the men five to three?\" When MacDonald had gone, Escher settled back in his chair and idly tapped his fingers on the desk-top. It was lucky that the Colonization Board worked on two levels. One was the well-publicized, idealistic level where nothing was too good and every deal was 99 and 44/100 per cent pure. But when things got too difficult for it to handle on that level, they went to Escher and MacDonald's department. The coal mine level. Nothing was too low, so long as it worked. Of course, if it didn't work, you took the lumps, too. He rummaged around in his drawer and found a list of the qualifications set up by the Board for potential colonists. He read the list slowly and frowned. You had to be physically fit for the rigors of space travel, naturally, but some of the qualifications were obviously silly. You couldn't guarantee physical perfection in the second generation, anyway. He tore the qualification list in shreds and dropped it in the disposal chute. That would have to be the first to go. There were other things that could be done immediately. For one thing, as it stood now, you were supposed to be financially able to colonize. Obviously a stupid and unappealing law. That would have to go next. He picked up the sheet of statistics that MacDonald had left and read it carefully. The Board could legalize polygamy, but that was no solution in the long run. Probably cause more problems than it would solve. Even with women as easy to handle as they were nowadays, one was still enough. Which still left him with the main problem of how to get people to colonize who didn't want to colonize. The first point was to convince them that they wanted to. The second point was that it might not matter whether they wanted to or not. No, it shouldn't be hard to solve at all—provided you held your nose, silenced your conscience, and were willing to forget that there was such a thing as a moral code. III Phyllis Hanson put the cover over her typewriter and locked the correspondence drawer. Another day was done, another evening about to begin. She filed into the washroom with the other girls and carefully redid her face. It was getting hard to disguise the worry lines, to paint away the faint crow's-feet around her eyes. She wasn't, she admitted to herself for the thousandth time, what you would call beautiful. She inspected herself carefully in her compact mirror. In a sudden flash of honesty, she had to admit that she wasn't even what you would call pretty. Her face was too broad, her nose a fraction too long, and her hair was dull. Not homely, exactly—but not pretty, either. Conversation hummed around her, most of it from the little group in the corner, where the extreme few who were married sat as practically a race apart. Their advice was sought, their suggestions avidly followed. \"Going out tonight, Phyl?\" She hesitated a moment, then slowly painted on the rest of her mouth. The question was technically a privacy violator, but she thought she would sidestep it this time, instead of refusing to answer point-blank. \"I thought I'd stay home tonight. Have a few things I want to rinse out.\" The black-haired girl next to her nodded sympathetically. \"Sure, Phyl, I know what you mean. Just like the rest of us—waiting for the phone to ring.\" Phyllis finished washing up and then left the office, carefully noting the girl who was waiting for the boss. The girl was beautiful in\n\n[Chapter: I_am_a_Nucleus_8]\nDanny appeared at that moment. His face was dripping. \"You all right,\nMr. Graham?\" he asked. \"I don't know what's going on around here, but\never since I came on this afternoon, things are going crazy. Bartley!\"\nhe shouted—he could succeed as a hog-caller. \"Bring those dames over\nhere!\"\n  \n \n  Three women in a confused wrangle, with their half-open umbrellas\nintertwined, were brought across the street, which meant climbing over\nfenders. Bartley, a fine young patrolman, seemed self-conscious; the\nladies seemed not to be.\n  \n \n  \"All right, now, Mrs. Mac-Philip!\" one of them said. \"Leave go of my\numbrella and we'll say no more about it!\"\n  \n \n  \"And so now it's Missus Mac-Philip, is it?\" said her adversary.\n  \n \n  The third, a younger one with her back turned to us, her umbrella also\ncaught in the tangle, pulled at it in a tentative way, at which the\nother two glared at her.

My nurse-wife.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Alec!\" she said, and managed to detach herself. \"Are you all\nright?\" Was\n   \n   I\n   \n  all right!\n  \n \n  \"Molly! What are you doing here?\"\n  \n \n  \"I was so worried, and when I saw all this, I didn't know what to\nthink.\" She pointed to the stalled cars. \"Are you really all right?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course I'm all right. But why....\"\n  \n \n  \"The Oyster Bay operator said someone kept dialing and dialing Mother's\nnumber and there wasn't anyone on the line, so then she had it traced\nand it came from our phone here.

He had an inward look.\nThen I caught Danny's eye. It had a thoughtful, almost suspicious cast\nto it.\n  \n \n  \"Trouble does seem to follow you, Mr. Graham,\" was all he said.\n  \n \n  When we got upstairs, I turned to McGill. \"Explain to Molly,\" I said.\n\"And incidentally to me. I'm not properly briefed yet.\"\n  \n \n  He did so, and when he got to the summing up, I had the feeling she was\na jump ahead of him.\n  \n \n  \"In other words, you think it's something organic?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" McGill said, \"I'm trying to think of anything else it might be.\nI'm not doing so well,\" he confessed.\n  \n \n  \"But so far as I can see,\" Molly answered, \"it's mere probability, and\nwithout any over-all pattern.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.\"\n\n[Chapter: I_am_a_Nucleus_5]\nUpstairs, the wind was blowing into the apartment and I closed the\nwindows, mainly to shut out the tumult and the shouting. Nat had\nbrightened up considerably.\n  \n \n  \"I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office,\" he said.\n\"You know, I think this would make an item for the paper.\" He grinned\nand nodded toward the pandemonium.\n  \n \n  When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk\nlamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except\none. That was tied in three knots.\n  \n \n  All\n   \n   right\n   \n  , I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had\ncome for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call\nMcGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university\nuptown and lives near us. He is highly imaginative, but we believe he\nknows everything.\n  \n \n  When I picked up the receiver, the line sounded dead and I thought,\n   \n   more\n   \n  trouble. Then I heard a man cough and I said hello. McGill's\nvoice said, \"Alec? You must have picked up the receiver just as we were\nconnected. That's a damn funny coincidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not in the least,\" I said. \"Come on over here. I've got something for\nyou to work on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, as a matter of fact, I was calling up to ask you and Molly—\"\n  \n \n  \"Molly's away for the week. Can you get over here quick? It's urgent.\"\n  \n \n  \"At once,\" he said, and hung up.\n  \n \n  While I waited, I thought I might try getting down a few paragraphs of\nmy novel—perhaps something would come now. It did, but as I came to a\npoint where I was about to put down the word \"agurgling,\" I decided it\nwas too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter\n\"R.\" Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to\nthe side of the correct ones, and tore out the page, with my face red.\n  \n \n  This was absolutely not my day.\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_10]\nAn hour later, Nitworth, breathing freely again, glowered across his\ndesk at Retief and Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"This entire affair,\" he rumbled, \"has made me appear to be a fool!\"\n  \n \n  \"But we who are privileged to serve on your staff already know just how\nclever you are,\" Magnan burbled.\n  \n \n  Nitworth purpled. \"You're skirting insolence, Magnan,\" he roared. \"Why\nwas I not informed of the arrangements?

His superior had retired and the replacement had not yet arrived, forcing him to take command amidst chaos and the skepticism of high-ranking officers who are alarmed that a non-commissioned officer is in such a crucial position. He asserts his authority based on his experience in the office.\n\n**Step 2: Facing Bureaucratic Disapproval**\nAndy immediately faces pushback from military bureaucracy. A two-star general expresses shock that a \"noncom is sitting on top of the whole powder keg.\" Later, a colonel arrives and is openly hostile to Andy's command. This conflict escalates until the colonel attempts to remove Andy from his post for supposed insubordination, demonstrating the rigid hierarchy that threatens to derail the investigation.

He was Sergeant Andy McCloud’s superior, and his replacement has yet to show up. Andy theorizes that the replacement for the lieutenant got caught up in all the red tape, but, at the end of the day, the newly-coined Germ War Protection needed a leader. And Andy was stepping up to the job. \n\tHe had worked at the Office of the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Coordinator for two years prior to the epidemic. He knew the ins and outs of the place, so, despite being a noncom, he was truly the best for the job. \n\tOne of his colleagues, Corporal Bettijean Baker, had picked up the phone two days prior, and suddenly their whole words changed. An epidemic was sweeping the nation, infecting random people left and right with no underlying cause or trend, and, despite the absence of fatalities, panic was ensuing. Though some of the officers disapprove of Andy’s noncom position, he continues working tirelessly with his colleagues to try and figure out the cause of this terrifying disease. \n\tHe and Corporal Bettijean Baker brainstorm throughout the story, desperately searching for a trend or place of infection. They realize that artists, poets, college students, and workers are the ones being infected; not necessarily doctors, dentists, and government employees. They try to figure out what activities each group does that could possibly have been the cause of their infection. They quickly rule out the disease traveling through water, wind, and food. And, later on, it’s revealed that the disease is not contagious. Bettijean and Andy put their heads together and think. \n\tTheir time spent together brainstorming was also filled with flirtatious moments. Andy, with his freckles and messy hair, and Bettijean with her jet-black hair, share a kiss or two throughout the story. \n\tAfter exhausting themselves, Andy orders all the girls to redirect all calls to go out, not in. They are to focus on hospitals and relief crews, to discover more on who the virus is infecting. He and Bettijean are almost fired by the disgruntled colonel, who came with two replacements. Thankfully, just as Andy kisses Bettijean, the general walks in and dismisses the colonel. He reinstates Andy and Bettijean to their former and rightful positions, before telling them that the Iron Curtain has gone silent, except for one coded message from two days before, possibly hinting at the epidemic. \n\tAfter the brass left, Bettijean and Andy brainstormed some more, looking through new reports brought in by Janis, a colleague. Janis soon collapses, and it is revealed that she’s been infected. Andy questions her and soon discovers the transmitter of the virus. Stamps! He relates the news to his higher-ups, and rejoices with Bettijean. They are given a 30-day furloughed vacation together, leaving the reader with a future of romance and hope. \n", "Sergeant Andy McCloud was the highest-ranking officer in the Office of Civil Health and Germ Warfare protection when the retired Co-ordinator’s replacement didn’t show up, so he found himself in charge of the office just as a nationwide epidemic was surging. He is berated by some of his superior officers who couldn’t fathom the idea of an officer not in a combat role being in charge of such a large issue, but pushed through and continued trying to work on a solution. He goes through piles of reports with Corporal Bettijean Baker, his assistant, trying to find something that connects the victims. The two of them work through a variety of emotions, including frustration, exhaustion, confusion, and exasperation. When the colonel comes back into Andy’s office to yell more about the severity of the situation that he doesn’t seem to think Andy is the right person to handle, Andy acknowledges him curtly, which makes the colonel relieve Andy of his duties. This whole time, Bettiejean is standing with him, gripping his shoulder in his defense. The threat doesn’t stick, even though Andy was somewhat relieved to have a chance to sleep, as a captain walks in and tells him to continue working. The captain tells the colonel that he and his captains have to report to Andy for the remainder of the crisis. During each of these interactions with superior officers, Andy relies on smoking a cigarette to find some focus, and tries to listen to the captain’s report about possible influence from the Soviet Union. He is upset, and in his exhaustion, loses hope for a moment as the general asks him what Andy can do about the situation, but then finds the courage to stand up and say that he’ll get the job done as long as people work with him on it. He worked through more reports with Bettijean until they were interrupted by a scream as Janis, one of the office workers, fell sick at her desk. Andy called for a doctor and a chemist, asked Janis everything that had happened to her that day, and pondered over the new evidence over another cigarette. He has an epiphany, frantically looks for Janis’ book of stamps in her purse, and sends a stamp with a lab technician. His hunch was right: the toxin that spreads the disease is on the adhesive side of the stamps. As he works on a response plan with the general, he calls out a few orders and then defers to the general to make the rest of the decisions in his exhaustion. The general then offers Andy and Bettiejean a month of furlough so that they can spend time with one another, and they look into each other’s eyes excited to explore their connection. ", "Andy begins the story as a non-commissioned officer running the Germ Warfare Protection division during a crisis. He was never assigned a commanding officer after his previous colonel's retirement 10 days prior. As a result he continually has to defend his standing and prove that he is the right individual to solve the mystery of the illness.\n\nHe works doggedly to try and establish a pattern or trend for the illness and calls tirelessly every hospital in the country until his hand cramps from writing and his voice verges on giving out.\n\nHe has to navigate an attempted takeover by the chicken colonel and his young officers. Eventually he pieces the mystery together by speaking to Janis, a phone operator who falls ill after licking a stamp. Finally he provides his recommendation on how to stop the illness and is rewarded with a long vacation and promotion.\n\n", "Andy has been working at the Office of the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection for two years when all hell breaks loose. He is put in charge of finding out how the new American plague is spreading, and he is deeply stressed. Chicken colonel attempts to discipline him for insubordination, but the two star general shoots down that idea and asks McCloud to keep working the case with everything he’s got.\n\nMcCloud and Bettlejean look through reports and gather that the disease is not communicable, and it is not only affecting people of a certain class or geographical area. The only clues that they can piece together are that the illness is affecting people who work in small offices rather than large buildings. They also recognize that artists and poets are becoming sick when doctors and dentists are not. \n\nMcCloud’s subordinate, a woman named Janis, suddenly becomes ill. After he questions her about her day and activities, he realizes that the culprit behind the outbreak must be postage stamps. He locates one of the stamps that Janis had in her work desk and sends it to be tested in the lab. \n\nWhen his boss, the general, comes in to hear about McCloud’s findings, he says with confidence that the postage stamps are behind the epidemic. When the lab confirms his suspicions, he is hailed as the hero. The general gives him time off to relax and recuperate from this entire ordeal, and he suggests that McCloud spend some of that time with Bettlejean. McCloud is so excited to get some alone time with his coworker that he barely hears the general detail the awards and accolades that McCloud will receive for his job well done. \n\n"]}}

Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n  \n \n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line—in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause—by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n  \n \n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n  \n \n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe\nthis replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the\nbrand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here.

As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n  \n \n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_7]\nIt was Bettijean who squeezed into the office and broke the brittle\nsilence. \"Andy, for heaven's sake, what is it?\" Then she moved around\nthe desk to stand behind him as he faced the officers.\n  \n \n  \"Have you got something?\" the brigadier asked. \"Some girl outside was\nbabbling about writers and doctors, and dentists and college students,\nand little secretaries and big secretaries. Have you established a\ntrend?\"\n  \n \n  Andy glanced at the lab report and his smile was as relieved as it was\nweary. \"Our problem,\" he said, \"was in figuring out what a writer does\nthat a doctor doesn't—why girls from small offices were sick—and why\nsenators and postal workers weren't—why college students caught the\nbug and people in a Tennessee community didn't.\n  \n \n  \"The lab report isn't complete. They haven't had time to isolate the\npoison and prescribe medication. But\"—he held up a four-cent\nstamp—\"here's the villain, gentlemen.\"\n  \n \n  The big brass stood stunned and shocked. Mouths flapped open and eyes\nbugged at Andy, at the stamp.\n  \n \n  Bettijean said, \"Sure. College kids and engaged girls and new parents\nand especially writers and artists and poets—they'd all lick lots of\nstamps. Professional men have secretaries. Big offices have\npostage-meter machines. And government offices have free franking.\nAnd\"—she threw her arms around the sergeant's neck—\"Andy, you're\nwonderful.\"\n  \n \n  \"The old American ingenuity,\" the colonel said, reaching for Andy's\nphone. \"I knew we could lick it. Now all we have to do—\"\n  \n \n  \"At ease, colonel,\" the brigadier said sharply. He waited until the\ncolonel had retreated, then addressed Andy. \"It's your show. What do\nyou suggest?\"\n  \n \n  \"Get somebody—maybe even the President—on all radio and TV networks.\nExplain frankly about the four-centers and warn against licking any\nstamps. Then—\"\n  \n \n  He broke off as his phone rang. Answering, he listened for a moment,\nthen hung up and said, \"But before the big announcement, get somebody\nchecking on the security clearances at whatever plant it is where they\nprint stamps. This's a big deal. Somebody may've been planted years\nago for this operation. It shouldn't be too hard.\n  \n \n  \"But there's no evidence it was a plot yet. Could be pure\naccident—some chemical in the stickum spoiled. Do they keep the\nstickum in barrels? Find out who had access. And ... oh, the phone\ncall. That was the lab. The antidote's simple and the cure should be\nquick. They can phone or broadcast the medical information to doctors.\nThe man on the phone said they could start emptying hospitals in six\nhours. And maybe we should release some propaganda. \"United States\nwhips mystery virus,\" or something like that. And we could send the\nKremlin a stamp collection and.... Aw, you take it, sir. I'm pooped.\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_5]\nThe brass exited wordlessly. Bettijean sighed noisily. Andy found his\ncigarette dead and lit another. He fancied a tiny lever in his brain\nand he shifted gears to direct his thinking back into the proper\nchannel. Abruptly his fatigue began to lift. He picked up the new pile\nof reports Bettijean had brought in.\n  \n \n  She move around the desk and sat, noting the phone book he had used,\nstudying the names he had crossed off. \"Did you learn anything?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  Andy coughed, trying to clear his raw throat. \"It's crazy,\" he said.\n\"From the Senate and House on down, I haven't found a single\ngovernment worker sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"I found a few,\" she said. \"Over in a Virginia hospital.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I did find,\" Andy said, flipping through pages of his own\nscrawl, \"a society matron and her social secretary, a whole flock of\noffice workers—business, not government—and new parents and newly\nengaged girls and....\" He shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice anything significant about those office workers?\"\n  \n \n  Andy nodded. \"I was going to ask you the same, since I was just\nguessing. I hadn't had time to check it out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I checked some. Practically none of my victims came from big\noffices, either business or industry. They were all out of one and\ntwo-girl offices or small businesses.\"\n  \n \n  \"That was my guess. And do you know that I didn't find a doctor,\ndentist or attorney?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nor a single postal worker.\"\n  \n \n  Andy tried to smile. \"One thing we do know. It's not a communicable\nthing. Thank heaven for—\"\n  \n \n  He broke off as a cute blonde entered and put stacks of reports before\nboth Andy and Bettijean. The girl hesitated, fidgeting, fingers to her\nteeth. Then, without speaking, she hurried out.\n  \n \n  Andy stared at the top sheet and groaned. \"This may be something. Half\nthe adult population of Aspen, Colorado, is down.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Bettijean frowned over the report in her hands. \"It's the same\nthing—only not quite as severe—in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\"\n  \n \n  \"Writers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mostly. Some artists, too, and musicians. And poets are among the\nhard hit.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is insane,\" Andy muttered. \"Doctors and dentists are\nfine—writers and poets are sick. Make sense out of that.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean held up a paper and managed a confused smile. \"Here's a\ncountry doctor in Tennessee. He doesn't even know what it's all about.\nNobody's sick in his valley.\"\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in our outer office is organized,\" Andy said, pulling at his\ncigarette. \"Here're reports from a dozen military installations all\nlumped together.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does it show?\"\n  \n \n  \"Black-out. By order of somebody higher up—no medical releases. Must\nmean they've got it.\" He scratched the growing stubble on his chin.\n\"If this were a fifth column setup, wouldn't the armed forces be the\nfirst hit?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" Bettijean brightened, then sobered. \"Maybe not. The brass\ncould keep it secret if an epidemic hit an army camp. And they could\nslap a control condition on any military area. But the panic will come\nfrom the general public.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here's another batch,\" Andy said. \"Small college towns under\ntwenty-five thousand population. All hard hit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, it's not split intellectually. Small colleges and small offices\nand writers get it. Doctors don't and dentists don't. But we can't\ntell who's got it on the military bases.\"\n  \n \n  \"And it's not geographical. Look, remember those two reports from\nTennessee? That place where they voted on water bonds or something,\neverybody had it. But the country doctor in another section hadn't\neven heard of it.\" Andy could only shake his head.\n  \n \n  Bettijean heaved herself up from the chair and trudged back to the\nouter office. She returned momentarily with a tray of food. Putting a\npaper cup of coffee and a sandwich in front of Andy, she sat down and\nnibbled at her snack like an exhausted chipmunk.\n  \n \n  Andy banged a fist at his desk again. Coffee splashed over the rim of\nhis cup onto the clutter of papers. \"It's here,\" he said angrily.\n\"It's here somewhere, but we can't find it.\"\n  \n \n  \"The answer?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course. What is it that girls in small offices do or eat or drink\nor wear that girls in large offices don't do or eat or drink or wear?\nWhat do writers and doctors do differently? Or poets and dentists?\nWhat are we missing? What—\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_8]\nThe general wheeled to fire a salvo of commands. Officers poured into\nthe corridor. Only the brigadier remained, a puzzled frown crinkling\nhis granite brow.\n  \n \n  \"But you said that postal workers weren't getting sick.\"\n  \n \n  Andy chucked. \"That's right. Did you ever see a post office clerk\nlick a stamp? They always use a sponge.\"\n  \n \n  The general looked to Bettijean, to Andy, to the stamp. He grinned and\nthe grin became a rumbling laugh. \"How would you two like a thirty-day\nfurlough to rest up—or to get better acquainted?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean squealed. Andy reached for her hand.\n  \n \n  \"And while you're gone,\" the general continued, \"I'll see what strings\nI can pull. If I can't wangle you a couple of battlefield commissions,\nI'll zip you both through O.C.S. so fast you won't even have time to\npin on the bars.\"\n  \n \n  But neither Andy nor Bettijean had heard a word after the mention of\nfurlough. Like a pair of puppy-lovers, they were sinking into the\ndepths of each other's eyes.\n  \n \n  And the general was still chuckling as he picked up the lone four-cent\nstamp in his left hand, made a gun of his right hand, and marched the\nstamp out of the office under guard.\n  \n \n  THE END\n\n[Chapter: INNOCENT_AT_LARGE_13]\nDoran blew up in laughter. \"That is one thing I would never spill, even\nwithout security. I told you about my girl friend, didn't I?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, and that calls to mind the Little Girl,\" said Matheny\napologetically. \"She was another official project.\"\n  \n \n  \"Who?\"\n  \n \n  \"Remember Junie O'Brien? The little golden-haired girl on Mars, a\nmathematical prodigy, but dying of an incurable disease? She collected\nEarth coins.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, that. Sure, I remember—Hey! You didn't!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. We made about a billion dollars on that one.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will be double damned. You know, Pete, I sent her a hundred-buck\npiece myself. Say, how is Junie O'Brien?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, fine. Under a different name, she's now our finance minister.\"\nMatheny stared out the wall, his hands twisting nervously behind his\nback. \"There were no lies involved. She really does have a fatal\ndisease. So do you and I. Every day we grow older.\"\n  \n \n  \"Uh!\" exclaimed Doran.\n  \n \n  \"And then the Red Ankh Society. You must have seen or heard their ads.\n'What mysterious knowledge did the Old Martians possess? What was\nthe secret wisdom of the Ancient Aliens? Now the incredibly powerful\nsemantics of the Red Ankh (not a religious organization) is available\nto a select few—' That's our largest dollar-earning enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  He would have liked to say it was his suggestion originally, but it\nwould have been too presumptuous. He was talking to an Earthman, who\nhad heard everything already.\n  \n \n  Doran whistled.\n  \n \n  \"That's about all, so far,\" confessed Matheny. \"Perhaps a con is our\nonly hope. I've been wondering, maybe we could organize a Martian\nbucket shop, handling Martian securities, but—well, I don't know.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think—\" Doran removed the helmet and stood up.\n  \n \n  \"Yes?\" Matheny faced around, shivering with his own tension.\n  \n \n  \"I may be able to find the man you want,\" said Doran. \"I just may. It\nwill take a few days and might get a little expensive.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean.... Mr. Doran—Gus—you could actually—\"\n  \n \n  \"I cannot promise anything yet except that I will try. Now you finish\ndressing. I will be down in the bar. And I will call up this girl I\nknow. We deserve a celebration!\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_3]\nIt was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n  \n \n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto—\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n  \n \n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and—\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man—\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't—\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from—\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_2]\nBettijean crossed briskly to his desk. She gave him a motherly smile\nas she put down a thick sheaf of papers. \"You look beat,\" she said.\n\"Brass give you much trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not much. We're top priority now.\" He ran fingers through the thick,\nbrown hair and massaged his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to\nhis wary and confused brain. \"What's new?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've gone though some of these,\" she said. \"Tried to save you a\nlittle time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. Sit down.\"\n  \n \n  She pulled up a chair and thumbed through the papers. \"So far, no\nfatalities. That's why there's no panic yet, I guess. But it's\nspreading like ... well, like a plague.\" Fear flickered deep in her\ndark eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Any water reports?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"Wichita O.K., Indianapolis O.K., Tulsa O.K., Buffalo O.K.,—and a\nbunch more. No indication there. Except\"—she fished out a one-page\nreport—\"some little town in Tennessee. Yesterday there was a campaign\nfor everybody to write their congressman about some deal and today\nthey were to vote on a new water system. Hardly anybody showed up at\nthe polls. They've all got it.\"\n  \n \n  Andy shrugged. \"You can drink water, but don't vote for it. Oh, that's\na big help.\" He rummaged through the clutter on his desk and came up\nwith a crude chart. \"Any trends yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's hitting everybody,\" Bettijean said helplessly. \"Not many kids so\nfar, thank heavens. But housewives, businessmen, office workers,\nteachers, preachers—rich, poor—from Florida to Alaska. Just when you\ncalled me in, one of the girls thought she had a trend. The isolated\nmountain areas of the West and South. But reports are too\nfragmentary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\" he cried suddenly, banging the desk. \"People deathly\nill, but nobody dying. And doctors can't identify the poison until\nthey have a fatality for an autopsy. People stricken in every part of\nthe country, but the water systems are pure. How does it spread?\"\n  \n \n  \"In food?\"\n  \n \n  \"How? There must be hundreds of canneries and dairies and packing\nplants over the country. How could they all goof at the same\ntime—even if it was sabotage?\"\n  \n \n  \"On the wind?\"\n  \n \n  \"But who could accurately predict every wind over the entire\ncountry—even Alaska and Hawaii—without hitting Canada or Mexico? And\nwhy wouldn't everybody get it in a given area?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean's smooth brow furrowed and she reached across the desk to\ngrip his icy, sweating hands. \"Andy, do ... do you think it's ...\nwell, an enemy?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I just don't know.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment he sat there, trying to draw strength from her,\npunishing his brain for the glimmer of an idea. Finally, shaking his\nhead, he pushed back into his chair and reached for the sheaf of\npapers.\n  \n \n  \"We've got to find a clue—a trend—an inkling of something.\" He\nnodded toward the outer office. \"Stop all in-coming calls. Get those\ngirls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country.\nHave them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up\nanother relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and\nsandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and\noccupation of the victims. You and I'll start with Washington.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode\nfrom the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on\nthe phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone\nand directory.\n  \n \n  He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to\nworried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical\nnurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible\nscrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned\ndown to a rasping whisper. But columns climbed up his rough chart and\nbroken lines pointed vaguely to trends.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_4]\nAnd from the door, an icy voice said, \"Yes, colonel?\"\n  \n \n  The colonel and his captains wheeled, stared and saluted. \"Oh,\ngeneral,\" the colonel said. \"I was just—\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" the brigadier said, stepping into the room. \"I've been\nlistening to you. And I thought I suggested that everybody leave the\nsergeant and his staff alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general, I—\"\n  \n \n  The general showed the colonel his back and motioned Andy into his\nchair. He glanced to Bettijean and a smile warmed his wedge face.\n\"Corporal, were you speaking just then as a woman or as a soldier?\"\n  \n \n  Crimson erupted into Bettijean's face and her tight laugh said many\nthings. She shrugged. \"Both I guess.\"\n  \n \n  The general waved her to a chair and, oblivious of the colonel, pulled\nup a chair for himself. The last trace of humor drained from his face\nas he leaned elbows on the desk. \"Andy, this is even worse than we had\nfeared.\"\n  \n \n  Andy fumbled for a cigarette and Bettijean passed him a match. A\ncaptain opened his mouth to speak, but the colonel shushed him.\n  \n \n  \"I've just come from Intelligence,\" the general said. \"We haven't had\na report—nothing from our agents, from the Diplomatic Corps, from the\ncivilian newspapermen—not a word from any Iron Curtain country for a\nday and half. Everybody's frantic. The last item we had—it was a\ncoded message the Reds'd tried to censor—was an indication of\nsomething big in the works.\"\n  \n \n  \"A day and half ago,\" Andy mused. \"Just about the time we knew we had\nan epidemic. And about the time they knew it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It could be just propaganda,\" Bettijean said hopefully, \"proving that\nthey could cripple us from within.\"\n  \n \n  The general nodded. \"Or it could be the softening up for an all-out\neffort. Every American base in the world is alerted and every\nserviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've\nstill got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're\nright ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?\"\n  \n \n  Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through\nmuffled. \"I can sit here and cry.\" For an eternity he sat there,\nfutility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm.\nHe heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement\nthat silenced him.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. \"We'll\nfind your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.\"\n  \n \n  The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then\nlaunched himself from the chair. Pivoting, he said, \"Colonel, you and\nyour captains will be stationed by that switchboard out there. For the\nduration of this emergency, you will take orders only from the\nsergeant and the corporal here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general,\" the colonel wailed, \"a noncom? I'm assigned—\"\n  \n \n  The general snorted. \"Insubordination cannot be tolerated—unless you\nfind a two-star general to outrank me. Now, as I said before, let's\nget out of here and let these people work.\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_6]\nIn the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did—everything you ate or drank—in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... I don't know. I think....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance\nsought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob.\n\"Did I do wrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's\ncertainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it\neasy and—. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers—Aspen, Taos and college towns—thousands of\npeople sick—but none in that valley in Tennessee—and few government\nworkers—just one girl in his office—and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter—and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Janis's character is significant because her falling ill and subsequent confession provide the final, crucial clue that allows Sergeant McCloud to solve the mystery of the epidemic.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  Before Janis collapses, Sergeant Andy McCloud and Corporal Bettijean are at a dead end. They have gathered a lot of data about who is getting sick (writers, artists, people in small offices) and who isn't (doctors, postal workers, government employees), but they cannot find the common thread connecting the victims. They are exhausted and frustrated, unable to identify the source of the plague.\n\n2.  Janis, a worker in their office, collapses with the exact symptoms of the epidemic. This provides Andy with a fresh, immediate case to investigate. He questions her about everything she has done in the past twelve hours, hoping to find the source of her infection.\n\n3.  During the interrogation, Janis is reluctant to share one specific action. After Andy reassures her, she confesses to a seemingly minor act that she feared was against regulations.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    Finally, resigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n    ##end_quote##\n\n4.  This confession is the catalyst for Andy's breakthrough. The idea of writing a letter and using a stamp connects all the disparate pieces of information he and Bettijean had gathered. He immediately realizes the potential source of the poison.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    He snatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse. Ripping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through the pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab technician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n    ##end_quote##\n\n5.  Janis's confession allows Andy to identify the poisoned four-cent stamps as the vector for the plague. This explains why writers, poets, new parents, and people in small offices (who would lick their own stamps) were getting sick, while doctors, government workers (who have free franking), and postal clerks (who use sponges) were not. Her role was pivotal in cracking the case.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    \"But\"—he held up a four-cent stamp—\"here's the villain, gentlemen.\"\n    ##end_quote##\n\n##Answer: The significance of Janis's character is that her collapse and subsequent confession about writing a letter provide the final, critical clue for Sergeant McCloud. This revelation allows him to deduce that the poison is on the adhesive of postage stamps, thus solving the mystery of the epidemic's transmission and leading to its resolution."}], "metadata": {"id": "268", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["In short, without Janis, Sergeant Andrew McCloud would not have discovered the cause of the epidemic as quickly or at all. \n\tNear the end of the story, Janis, an attractive blonde woman, enters Sergeant Andy’s office to deliver another stack of reports before him and Corporal Bettijean. The two of them had been analyzing the reports and statistics for several hours now, desperate to find a trend amongst those infected. So far, they had come up with nothing concrete, except for the types of people who were getting infected. Working people, artists, poets, newly engaged women, and small office workers were all turning up sick. Bigger offices, postal workers, doctors, dentists, and government workers were all fine. So, what’s the connection? \n\tAfter nervously delivering the reports, Janis quickly scurries out of the office and back to her desk elsewhere. Bettijean and Andy notice that the adult population in Aspen, Colorado; Taos; and Santa Fe, New Mexico is rapidly falling ill, all towns with prominent artistic industries. \n\tThey keep pouring over the reports, making new discoveries but still not coming up with any answers. Suddenly, a girl cries out from beyond his office. They hear a body fall to the floor, and they quickly rush out as the sounds of screaming emerge. Andy sends Bettijean to retrieve a doctor and a chemist, while he runs to help. Janis was lying on the floor, in pain and scared. Luckily, the virus is not contagious, so Andy and the others were able to help her. \n\tAndy interrogates her, asking detailed questions about her day and the past 12 hours. He tries to ascertain all the moments of her life, so he can pinpoint where and how she got infected. Her symptoms match up with the epidemic at hand (a fever and feeling dizzy), so Andy knows this is his best shot to find the origin. \n\tSlowly, she recounts her day and tells them all about what she did, where she was, and what she ate. She hides one thing though, which Andy quickly forces out of her. She wrote a letter to her mother, telling her about the epidemic and how scary it was. This is against regulations, as shown through Andy’s grunt of disapproval. She mailed it with her own stamps, not with a government envelope. \n\tAndy puts all the puzzle pieces together in his mind and realizes that all those people, Janis included, had one thing in common: writing letters. The poison was in the stamp. Without Janis, Andy would have struggled far longer to discover the illness and halt the production and sale of all stamps nationwide. \n\t\n", "Janis is the first person to fall sick with the mysterious disease in the Office of Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection. She had been one of the people delivering reports to Andy’s office, and head seemed nervous when she had entered last. She had fallen at her desk, and was shivering and horrified at what had happened. Once she was able to talk with Andy, he was able to ask her questions about her day. This was important because Andy had not yet found a connection that tied the victims of the epidemic together. He insisted that he tell her everything, and the fact that she sent a letter to her mother was the crucial fact that allowed Andy to put the story together. He was able to have Janis’ postage stamps tested for a toxin on the glued side, allowing him to finally find the root of the sickness and start the nationwide response, including giving the lab enough information to find out what was needed for a treatment. ", "Janis is the phone operator who falls ill as they are working to solve the mystery of the pandemic. She becomes the key to unlocking the mystery as she describes her day to Andy. She informs him that she sent a letter to her mother earlier in the day. This, along with the trends that are becoming apparent in the sick populations allows Andy to deduce that licking stamp adhesive is what is making people sick.", "Janis is the first person in McCloud’s office to become sick. First, she comes in to give him a report, and she fidgets and moves like she is nervous. Only a few minutes later, she collapses in the hallway. She is feverish and dizzy. \n\nWhen McCloud pressures her to tell him everything that she has consumed and done in the last day or so, Janis admits that she broke government regulations when she mailed a letter to her mother that detailed the epidemic. McCloud points out that she hardly let out a secret. The news of the epidemic has spread far and wide at this point. \n\nHe contemplates her story for several minutes and realizes that in order to send the letter, Janis must have licked a stamp. Janis’s illness turned out to be the essential clue. Without her explanation of the steps she took before she became sick, McCloud would not have the information he needed to solve the puzzle. \n"]}}

One that attacked only people within the\npolitical borders of the United States!\n   \n \n \n \n \n  Illustrated by Schoenherr\n  \n \n \n  Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud ignored the jangling telephones and the\nexcited jabber of a room full of brass, and lit a cigarette. Somebody\nhad to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.\n  \n \n  Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been\nanswering the rare call on the single line—in that friendly, husky\nvoice that gave even generals pause—by saying, \"Good morning. Office\nof the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.\" Now\nthere was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to\na dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And\nnow the harried girls answered with a hasty, \"Germ War Protection.\"\n  \n \n  All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office\ndeep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite\ncomprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny, or\nat least pathetic, if it hadn't been so desperate. Even so, Andy\nMcCloud's nerves and patience had frayed thin.\n  \n \n  \"I told you, general,\" he snapped to the flustered brigadier, \"Colonel\nPatterson was retired ten days ago. I don't know what happened. Maybe\nthis replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the\nbrand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in\ncharge.\"\n  \n \n  \"But this is incredible,\" a two-star general wailed. \"A mysterious\nepidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack\ntimed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top\nof the whole powder keg.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment\nbefore he could speak safely. Doggone the freckles and the unruly mop\nof hair that give him such a boyish look. \"May I remind you, general,\"\nhe said, \"that I've been entombed here for two years. My staff and I\nknow what to do. If you'll give us some co-operation and a priority,\nwe'll try to figure this thing out.\"\n  \n \n  \"But good heavens,\" a chicken colonel moaned, \"this is all so\nirregular. A noncom!\" He said it like a dirty word.\n  \n \n  \"Irregular, hell,\" the brigadier snorted, the message getting through.\n\"There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the\nsergeant get to work.\" He took a step toward the door, and the other\nofficers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they\ndrifted out, he turned and said, \"We'll clear your office for top\npriority.\" Then dead serious, he added, \"Son, a whole nation could\npanic at any moment. You've got to come through.\"\n  \n \n  Andy didn't waste time standing. He merely nodded to the general,\nsnubbed out his cigarette, and buzzed the intercom. \"Bettijean, will\nyou bring me all the latest reports, please?\" Then he peeled out of\nhis be-ribboned blouse and rolled up his sleeves. He allowed himself\none moment to enjoy the sight of the slim, black-headed corporal who\nentered his office.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_5]\nThe brass exited wordlessly. Bettijean sighed noisily. Andy found his\ncigarette dead and lit another. He fancied a tiny lever in his brain\nand he shifted gears to direct his thinking back into the proper\nchannel. Abruptly his fatigue began to lift. He picked up the new pile\nof reports Bettijean had brought in.\n  \n \n  She move around the desk and sat, noting the phone book he had used,\nstudying the names he had crossed off. \"Did you learn anything?\" she\nasked.\n  \n \n  Andy coughed, trying to clear his raw throat. \"It's crazy,\" he said.\n\"From the Senate and House on down, I haven't found a single\ngovernment worker sick.\"\n  \n \n  \"I found a few,\" she said. \"Over in a Virginia hospital.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I did find,\" Andy said, flipping through pages of his own\nscrawl, \"a society matron and her social secretary, a whole flock of\noffice workers—business, not government—and new parents and newly\nengaged girls and....\" He shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice anything significant about those office workers?\"\n  \n \n  Andy nodded. \"I was going to ask you the same, since I was just\nguessing. I hadn't had time to check it out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I checked some. Practically none of my victims came from big\noffices, either business or industry. They were all out of one and\ntwo-girl offices or small businesses.\"\n  \n \n  \"That was my guess. And do you know that I didn't find a doctor,\ndentist or attorney?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nor a single postal worker.\"\n  \n \n  Andy tried to smile. \"One thing we do know. It's not a communicable\nthing. Thank heaven for—\"\n  \n \n  He broke off as a cute blonde entered and put stacks of reports before\nboth Andy and Bettijean. The girl hesitated, fidgeting, fingers to her\nteeth. Then, without speaking, she hurried out.\n  \n \n  Andy stared at the top sheet and groaned. \"This may be something. Half\nthe adult population of Aspen, Colorado, is down.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Bettijean frowned over the report in her hands. \"It's the same\nthing—only not quite as severe—in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico.\"\n  \n \n  \"Writers?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mostly. Some artists, too, and musicians. And poets are among the\nhard hit.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is insane,\" Andy muttered. \"Doctors and dentists are\nfine—writers and poets are sick. Make sense out of that.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean held up a paper and managed a confused smile. \"Here's a\ncountry doctor in Tennessee. He doesn't even know what it's all about.\nNobody's sick in his valley.\"\n  \n \n  \"Somebody in our outer office is organized,\" Andy said, pulling at his\ncigarette. \"Here're reports from a dozen military installations all\nlumped together.\"\n  \n \n  \"What does it show?\"\n  \n \n  \"Black-out. By order of somebody higher up—no medical releases. Must\nmean they've got it.\" He scratched the growing stubble on his chin.\n\"If this were a fifth column setup, wouldn't the armed forces be the\nfirst hit?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" Bettijean brightened, then sobered. \"Maybe not. The brass\ncould keep it secret if an epidemic hit an army camp. And they could\nslap a control condition on any military area. But the panic will come\nfrom the general public.\"\n  \n \n  \"Here's another batch,\" Andy said. \"Small college towns under\ntwenty-five thousand population. All hard hit.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, it's not split intellectually. Small colleges and small offices\nand writers get it. Doctors don't and dentists don't. But we can't\ntell who's got it on the military bases.\"\n  \n \n  \"And it's not geographical. Look, remember those two reports from\nTennessee? That place where they voted on water bonds or something,\neverybody had it. But the country doctor in another section hadn't\neven heard of it.\" Andy could only shake his head.\n  \n \n  Bettijean heaved herself up from the chair and trudged back to the\nouter office. She returned momentarily with a tray of food. Putting a\npaper cup of coffee and a sandwich in front of Andy, she sat down and\nnibbled at her snack like an exhausted chipmunk.\n  \n \n  Andy banged a fist at his desk again. Coffee splashed over the rim of\nhis cup onto the clutter of papers. \"It's here,\" he said angrily.\n\"It's here somewhere, but we can't find it.\"\n  \n \n  \"The answer?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course. What is it that girls in small offices do or eat or drink\nor wear that girls in large offices don't do or eat or drink or wear?\nWhat do writers and doctors do differently? Or poets and dentists?\nWhat are we missing? What—\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_4]\nAnd from the door, an icy voice said, \"Yes, colonel?\"\n  \n \n  The colonel and his captains wheeled, stared and saluted. \"Oh,\ngeneral,\" the colonel said. \"I was just—\"\n  \n \n  \"I know,\" the brigadier said, stepping into the room. \"I've been\nlistening to you. And I thought I suggested that everybody leave the\nsergeant and his staff alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general, I—\"\n  \n \n  The general showed the colonel his back and motioned Andy into his\nchair. He glanced to Bettijean and a smile warmed his wedge face.\n\"Corporal, were you speaking just then as a woman or as a soldier?\"\n  \n \n  Crimson erupted into Bettijean's face and her tight laugh said many\nthings. She shrugged. \"Both I guess.\"\n  \n \n  The general waved her to a chair and, oblivious of the colonel, pulled\nup a chair for himself. The last trace of humor drained from his face\nas he leaned elbows on the desk. \"Andy, this is even worse than we had\nfeared.\"\n  \n \n  Andy fumbled for a cigarette and Bettijean passed him a match. A\ncaptain opened his mouth to speak, but the colonel shushed him.\n  \n \n  \"I've just come from Intelligence,\" the general said. \"We haven't had\na report—nothing from our agents, from the Diplomatic Corps, from the\ncivilian newspapermen—not a word from any Iron Curtain country for a\nday and half. Everybody's frantic. The last item we had—it was a\ncoded message the Reds'd tried to censor—was an indication of\nsomething big in the works.\"\n  \n \n  \"A day and half ago,\" Andy mused. \"Just about the time we knew we had\nan epidemic. And about the time they knew it.\"\n  \n \n  \"It could be just propaganda,\" Bettijean said hopefully, \"proving that\nthey could cripple us from within.\"\n  \n \n  The general nodded. \"Or it could be the softening up for an all-out\neffort. Every American base in the world is alerted and every\nserviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've\nstill got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're\nright ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?\"\n  \n \n  Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through\nmuffled. \"I can sit here and cry.\" For an eternity he sat there,\nfutility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm.\nHe heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement\nthat silenced him.\n  \n \n  Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. \"We'll\nfind your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.\"\n  \n \n  The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then\nlaunched himself from the chair. Pivoting, he said, \"Colonel, you and\nyour captains will be stationed by that switchboard out there. For the\nduration of this emergency, you will take orders only from the\nsergeant and the corporal here.\"\n  \n \n  \"But, general,\" the colonel wailed, \"a noncom? I'm assigned—\"\n  \n \n  The general snorted. \"Insubordination cannot be tolerated—unless you\nfind a two-star general to outrank me. Now, as I said before, let's\nget out of here and let these people work.\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_6]\nIn the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk,\nthen a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.\n  \n \n  Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to\nBettijean, \"Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.\"\n  \n \n  It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she\nlay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering,\nshivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the\nhall door, plainly ready to stampede.\n  \n \n  \"It's not contagious,\" Andy growled. \"Find some blankets or coats to\ncover her. And get a glass of water.\"\n  \n \n  The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the\nfallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used\na chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a\nblanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of\nwater and heard somebody murmur, \"Poor Janis.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Andy said brightly, \"how's that, Janis?\"\n  \n \n  She mustered a smile, and breathed, \"Better. I ... I was so scared.\nFever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.\"\n  \n \n  \"Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,\" Andy said, feeling\nsuddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside\nmanner. \"You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked\nout with this stuff yet.\"\n  \n \n  Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.\n  \n \n  \"Don't hurry,\" Andy said, \"but I want you to tell me everything that\nyou did—everything you ate or drank—in the last ... oh, twelve\nhours.\" He felt a pressure behind him and swiveled his head to see\nBettijean standing there. He tried to smile.\n  \n \n  \"What time is it?\" Janis asked weakly.\n  \n \n  Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.\n  \n \n  One of the girls said, \"It's three o'clock in the morning.\" She edged\nnearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of\nattention. Andy ignored her.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,\"\nJanis said. \"I came to work as usual and....\"\n  \n \n  Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then\ntold about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying\non her phone and typewriter for another five hours. \"It was about\neleven when the relief crew came in.\"\n  \n \n  \"What did you do then?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I took a break and....\" Her ivory skin reddened, the color\nspreading into the roots of her fluffy curls, and she turned her face\naway from Andy. \"And I had a sandwich and some coffee and got a little\nnap in the ladies' lounge and ... and that's all.\"\n  \n \n  \"And that's not all,\" Andy prompted. \"What else?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nothing,\" Janis said too quickly.\n  \n \n  Andy shook his head. \"Tell it all and maybe it'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"But ... but....\"\n  \n \n  \"Was it something against regulations?\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... I don't know. I think....\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll vouch for your job in this office.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well....\" She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance\nsought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally,\nresigned, she said, \"I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.\"\n  \n \n  Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. \"And you told her\nabout what we were doing here.\"\n  \n \n  Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Did you mail it?\"\n  \n \n  \"Y ... yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.\" She choked down a sob.\n\"Did I do wrong?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, I don't think so,\" Andy said, patting her shoulder. \"There's\ncertainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it\neasy and—. Oh, here's a doctor now.\"\n  \n \n  The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A\nlab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only\nshrug and indicate the girl.\n  \n \n  Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of\nthoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society\nmatrons, office workers—Aspen, Taos and college towns—thousands of\npeople sick—but none in that valley in Tennessee—and few government\nworkers—just one girl in his office—and she was sicker and more\nfrightened about a letter—and....\n  \n \n  \"Hey, wait!\" Andy yelled.\n  \n \n  Everyone in the room froze as Andy spun around, dashed to Bettijean's\ndesk and yanked out the wide, top drawer. He pawed through it,\nstraightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He\nsnatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse.\nRipping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through\nthe pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab\ntechnician, he said, \"Get me a report. Fast.\"\n  \n \n  The technician darted out.\n  \n \n  Andy wheeled to Bettijean. \"Get the brass in here. And call the\ngeneral first.\" To the doctor, he said, \"Give that girl the best of\neverything.\"\n  \n \n  Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports. He\nwas still poring over them when the general arrived. Half a dozen\nother brass hats, none of whom had been to bed, were close behind. The\nlab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed\nhis hastily scribbled report to Andy.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_8]\nThe general wheeled to fire a salvo of commands. Officers poured into\nthe corridor. Only the brigadier remained, a puzzled frown crinkling\nhis granite brow.\n  \n \n  \"But you said that postal workers weren't getting sick.\"\n  \n \n  Andy chucked. \"That's right. Did you ever see a post office clerk\nlick a stamp? They always use a sponge.\"\n  \n \n  The general looked to Bettijean, to Andy, to the stamp. He grinned and\nthe grin became a rumbling laugh. \"How would you two like a thirty-day\nfurlough to rest up—or to get better acquainted?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean squealed. Andy reached for her hand.\n  \n \n  \"And while you're gone,\" the general continued, \"I'll see what strings\nI can pull. If I can't wangle you a couple of battlefield commissions,\nI'll zip you both through O.C.S. so fast you won't even have time to\npin on the bars.\"\n  \n \n  But neither Andy nor Bettijean had heard a word after the mention of\nfurlough. Like a pair of puppy-lovers, they were sinking into the\ndepths of each other's eyes.\n  \n \n  And the general was still chuckling as he picked up the lone four-cent\nstamp in his left hand, made a gun of his right hand, and marched the\nstamp out of the office under guard.\n  \n \n  THE END\n\n[Chapter: CONTROL_GROUP_2]\na colony under the very antennae of the Bees. Longevity wasn't developed until around the year 3000—Lee here was one of the first to profit by it, if you remember—and suspended animation is still to come. So there's one theory you can forget.\" \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said reluctantly. \"An atomic-powered ship couldn't have made such a trip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant project couldn't have lasted through forty generations, speculative fiction to the contrary—the later generations would have been too far removed in ideology and intent from their ancestors. They'd have adapted to shipboard life as the norm. They'd have atrophied physically, perhaps even have mutated—\" \"And they'd never have fought past the Bees during the Hymenop invasion and occupation,\" Farrell finished triumphantly. \"The Bees had better detection equipment than we had. They'd have picked this ship up long before it reached Alphard Six.\" \"But the ship wasn't here in 3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is now. Therefore it must have arrived at some time during the two hundred years of Hymenop occupation and evacuation.\" Farrell, tangled in contradictions, swore bitterly. \"But why should the Bees let them through? The three domes on Five are over two hundred years old, which means that the Bees were here before the ship came. Why didn't they blast it or enslave its crew?\" \"We haven't touched on all the possibilities,\" Gibson reminded him. \"We haven't even established yet that these people were never under Hymenop control. Precedent won't hold always, and there's no predicting nor evaluating the motives of an alien race. We never understood the Hymenops because there's no common ground of logic between us. Why try to interpret their intentions now?\" Farrell threw up his hands in disgust. \"Next you'll say this is an ancient Terran expedition that actually succeeded! There's only one way to answer the questions we've raised, and that's to go down and see for ourselves. Ready, Xav?\" But uncertainty nagged uneasily at him when Farrell found himself alone in the helihopper with the forest flowing beneath like a leafy river and Xavier's scouter disappearing bulletlike into the dusk ahead. We never found a colony so advanced, Farrell thought. Suppose this is a Hymenop experiment that really paid off? The Bees did some weird and wonderful things with human guinea pigs—what if they've created the ultimate booby trap here, and primed it with conditioned myrmidons in our own form? Suppose, he thought—and derided himself for thinking it—one of those suicidal old interstellar ventures did succeed? Xavier's voice, a mellow drone from the helihopper's Ringwave-powered visicom, cut sharply into his musing. \"The ship has discovered the scouter and is training an electronic beam upon it. My instruments record an electromagnetic vibration pattern of low power but rapidly varying frequency. The operation seems pointless.\" Stryker's voice followed, querulous with worry: \"I'd better pull Xav back. It may be something lethal.\" \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised. Surprisingly, there was excitement in the engineer's voice. \"I think they're trying to communicate with us.\" Farrell was on the point of demanding acidly to know how one went about communicating by means of a fluctuating electric field when the unexpected cessation of forest diverted his attention. The helihopper scudded over a cultivated area of considerable extent, fields stretching below in a vague random checkerboard of lighter and darker earth, an undefined cluster of buildings at their center. There was a central bonfire that burned like a wild red eye against the lower gloom, and in its plunging ruddy glow he made out an urgent scurrying of shadowy figures. \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\" Farrell reported. \"The one nearest the city, I think. There's something odd going on down—\" Catastrophe struck so suddenly that he was caught completely unprepared. The helihopper's flimsy carriage bucked and crumpled. There was a blinding flare of electric discharge, a pungent stink of ozone and a stunning shock that flung him headlong into darkness. He awoke slowly with a brutal headache and a conviction of nightmare heightened by the outlandish tone of his surroundings. He lay on a narrow bed in a whitely antiseptic infirmary, an oblong metal cell cluttered with a grimly utilitarian array of tables and lockers and chests. The lighting was harsh and overbright and the air hung thick with pungent unfamiliar chemical odors. From somewhere, far off yet at the same time as near as the bulkhead above him, came the unceasing drone of machinery. Farrell sat up, groaning, when full consciousness made his position clear. He had been shot down by God knew what sort of devastating unorthodox weapon and was a prisoner in the grounded ship. At his rising, a white-smocked fat man with anachronistic spectacles and close-cropped gray hair came into the room, moving with the professional assurance of a medic. The man stopped short at Farrell's stare and spoke; his words were utterly unintelligible, but his gesture was unmistakable. Farrell followed him dumbly out of the infirmary and down a bare corridor whose metal floor rang coldly underfoot. An open port near the corridor's end relieved the blankness of wall and let in a flood of reddish Alphardian sunlight; Farrell slowed to look out, wondering how long he had lain unconscious, and felt panic knife at him when he saw Xavier's scouter lying, port open and undefended, on the square outside. The mechanical had been as easily taken as himself, then. Stryker and Gibson, for all their professional caution, would fare no better—they could not have overlooked the capture of Farrell and Xavier, and when they tried as a matter of course to rescue them the Marco would be struck down in turn by the same weapon. The fat medic turned and said something urgent in his unintelligible tongue. Farrell, dazed by the enormity of what had happened, followed without protest into an intersecting way that led through a bewildering succession of storage rooms and hydroponics gardens, through a small gymnasium fitted with physical training equipment in graduated sizes and finally into a soundproofed place that could have been nothing but a nursery. The implication behind its presence stopped Farrell short. \"A creche ,\" he said, stunned. He had a wild vision of endless generations of children growing up in this dim and stuffy room, to be taught from their first toddling steps the functions they must fulfill before the venture of which they were a part could be consummated. One of those old ventures had succeeded, he thought, and was awed by the daring of that thousand-year odyssey. The realization left him more alarmed than before—for what technical marvels might not an isolated group of such dogged specialists have developed during a millennium of application? Such a weapon as had brought down the helihopper and scouter was patently beyond reach of his own latter-day technology. Perhaps, he thought, its possession explained the presence of these people here in the first stronghold of the Hymenops; perhaps they had even fought and defeated the Bees on their own invaded ground. He followed his white-smocked guide through a power room where great crude generators whirred ponderously, pouring out gross electric current into arm-thick cables. They were nearing the bow of the ship when they passed by another open port and Farrell, glancing out over the lowered rampway, saw that his fears for Stryker and Gibson had been well grounded. The Marco Four , ports open, lay grounded outside. Farrell could not have said, later, whether his next move was planned or reflexive. The whole desperate issue seemed to hang suspended for a breathless moment upon a hair-fine edge of decision, and in that instant he made his bid. Without pausing in his stride he sprang out and through the port and down the steep plane of the ramp. The rough stone pavement of the square drummed underfoot; sore muscles tore at him, and weakness was like a weight about his neck. He expected momentarily to be blasted out of existence. He reached the Marco Four with the startled shouts of his guide ringing unintelligibly in his ears. The port yawned; he plunged inside and stabbed at controls without waiting to seat himself. The ports swung shut. The ship darted up under his manipulation and arrowed into space with an acceleration that sprung his knees and made his vision swim blackly. He was so weak with strain and with the success of his coup that he all but fainted when Stryker, his scanty hair tousled and his fat face comical with bewilderment, stumbled out of his sleeping cubicle and bellowed at him. \"What the hell are you doing, Arthur? Take us down!\" Farrell gaped at him, speechless. Stryker lumbered past him and took the controls, spiraling the Marco Four down. Men swarmed outside the ports when the Reclamations craft settled gently to the square again. Gibson and Xavier reached the ship first; Gibson came inside quickly, leaving the mechanical outside making patient explanations to an excited group of Alphardians. Gibson put a reassuring hand on Farrell's\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_7]\nIt was Bettijean who squeezed into the office and broke the brittle\nsilence. \"Andy, for heaven's sake, what is it?\" Then she moved around\nthe desk to stand behind him as he faced the officers.\n  \n \n  \"Have you got something?\" the brigadier asked. \"Some girl outside was\nbabbling about writers and doctors, and dentists and college students,\nand little secretaries and big secretaries. Have you established a\ntrend?\"\n  \n \n  Andy glanced at the lab report and his smile was as relieved as it was\nweary. \"Our problem,\" he said, \"was in figuring out what a writer does\nthat a doctor doesn't—why girls from small offices were sick—and why\nsenators and postal workers weren't—why college students caught the\nbug and people in a Tennessee community didn't.\n  \n \n  \"The lab report isn't complete. They haven't had time to isolate the\npoison and prescribe medication. But\"—he held up a four-cent\nstamp—\"here's the villain, gentlemen.\"\n  \n \n  The big brass stood stunned and shocked. Mouths flapped open and eyes\nbugged at Andy, at the stamp.\n  \n \n  Bettijean said, \"Sure. College kids and engaged girls and new parents\nand especially writers and artists and poets—they'd all lick lots of\nstamps. Professional men have secretaries. Big offices have\npostage-meter machines. And government offices have free franking.\nAnd\"—she threw her arms around the sergeant's neck—\"Andy, you're\nwonderful.\"\n  \n \n  \"The old American ingenuity,\" the colonel said, reaching for Andy's\nphone. \"I knew we could lick it. Now all we have to do—\"\n  \n \n  \"At ease, colonel,\" the brigadier said sharply. He waited until the\ncolonel had retreated, then addressed Andy. \"It's your show. What do\nyou suggest?\"\n  \n \n  \"Get somebody—maybe even the President—on all radio and TV networks.\nExplain frankly about the four-centers and warn against licking any\nstamps. Then—\"\n  \n \n  He broke off as his phone rang. Answering, he listened for a moment,\nthen hung up and said, \"But before the big announcement, get somebody\nchecking on the security clearances at whatever plant it is where they\nprint stamps. This's a big deal. Somebody may've been planted years\nago for this operation. It shouldn't be too hard.\n  \n \n  \"But there's no evidence it was a plot yet. Could be pure\naccident—some chemical in the stickum spoiled. Do they keep the\nstickum in barrels? Find out who had access. And ... oh, the phone\ncall. That was the lab. The antidote's simple and the cure should be\nquick. They can phone or broadcast the medical information to doctors.\nThe man on the phone said they could start emptying hospitals in six\nhours. And maybe we should release some propaganda. \"United States\nwhips mystery virus,\" or something like that. And we could send the\nKremlin a stamp collection and.... Aw, you take it, sir. I'm pooped.\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_3]\nIt was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with\nanother stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a\ncigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean\ncried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.\n  \n \n  Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who\ntrailed after the colonel. Emotionally exhausted, he had to clamp his\njaw against a huge laugh that struggled up in his throat. For just an\ninstant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of\nGeneral Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a\nswagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded\nnewspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.\n  \n \n  \"RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,\" the scare headline screamed. Andy's first\nglance caught such phrases as \"alleged Russian plot\" and \"germ\nwarfare\" and \"authorities hopelessly baffled.\"\n  \n \n  Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. \"That'll\nhelp a lot,\" he growled hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"Well, then, Sergeant.\" The colonel tried to relax his square face,\nbut tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the\npale gray eyes. \"So you finally recognize the gravity of the\nsituation.\"\n  \n \n  Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.\nBettijean stepped quickly around the desk and laid a steady hand on\nhis shoulder.\n  \n \n  \"Colonel,\" she said levelly, \"you should know better than that.\"\n  \n \n  A shocked young captain exploded, \"Corporal. Maybe you'd better report\nto—\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Andy said sharply.\n  \n \n  For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled\nslowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,\n\"You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some\nof the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're\nsurviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that\nmakes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.\" He felt\nBettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her\na tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. \"So say\nwhat you came here to say and let us get back to work.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sergeant,\" the captain said, as if reading from a manual,\n\"insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.\nYour conduct here will be noted and—\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, good heavens!\" Bettijean cried, her fingers biting into Andy's\nshoulder. \"Do you have to come in here trying to throw your weight\naround when this man—\"\n  \n \n  \"That's enough,\" the colonel snapped. \"I had hoped that you two would\nco-operate, but....\" He let the sentence trail off as he swelled up a\nbit with his own importance. \"I have turned Washington upside down to\nget these two officers from the surgeon general's office. Sergeant.\nCorporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will\nreport to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.\n\"But you can't—\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's go,\" Andy said, pushing up from his chair. Ignoring the brass,\nhe turned to her and brushed his lips across hers. \"Let them sweat a\nwhile. Let 'em have the whole stinking business. Whatever they do to\nus, at least we can get some sleep.\"\n  \n \n  \"But you can't quit now,\" Bettijean protested. \"These brass hats don't\nknow from—\"\n  \n \n  \"Corporal!\" the colonel roared.\n\n[Chapter: THE_PLAGUE_2]\nBettijean crossed briskly to his desk. She gave him a motherly smile\nas she put down a thick sheaf of papers. \"You look beat,\" she said.\n\"Brass give you much trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not much. We're top priority now.\" He ran fingers through the thick,\nbrown hair and massaged his scalp, trying to generate stimulation to\nhis wary and confused brain. \"What's new?\"\n  \n \n  \"I've gone though some of these,\" she said. \"Tried to save you a\nlittle time.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. Sit down.\"\n  \n \n  She pulled up a chair and thumbed through the papers. \"So far, no\nfatalities. That's why there's no panic yet, I guess. But it's\nspreading like ... well, like a plague.\" Fear flickered deep in her\ndark eyes.\n  \n \n  \"Any water reports?\" Andy asked.\n  \n \n  \"Wichita O.K., Indianapolis O.K., Tulsa O.K., Buffalo O.K.,—and a\nbunch more. No indication there. Except\"—she fished out a one-page\nreport—\"some little town in Tennessee. Yesterday there was a campaign\nfor everybody to write their congressman about some deal and today\nthey were to vote on a new water system. Hardly anybody showed up at\nthe polls. They've all got it.\"\n  \n \n  Andy shrugged. \"You can drink water, but don't vote for it. Oh, that's\na big help.\" He rummaged through the clutter on his desk and came up\nwith a crude chart. \"Any trends yet?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's hitting everybody,\" Bettijean said helplessly. \"Not many kids so\nfar, thank heavens. But housewives, businessmen, office workers,\nteachers, preachers—rich, poor—from Florida to Alaska. Just when you\ncalled me in, one of the girls thought she had a trend. The isolated\nmountain areas of the West and South. But reports are too\nfragmentary.\"\n  \n \n  \"What is it?\" he cried suddenly, banging the desk. \"People deathly\nill, but nobody dying. And doctors can't identify the poison until\nthey have a fatality for an autopsy. People stricken in every part of\nthe country, but the water systems are pure. How does it spread?\"\n  \n \n  \"In food?\"\n  \n \n  \"How? There must be hundreds of canneries and dairies and packing\nplants over the country. How could they all goof at the same\ntime—even if it was sabotage?\"\n  \n \n  \"On the wind?\"\n  \n \n  \"But who could accurately predict every wind over the entire\ncountry—even Alaska and Hawaii—without hitting Canada or Mexico? And\nwhy wouldn't everybody get it in a given area?\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean's smooth brow furrowed and she reached across the desk to\ngrip his icy, sweating hands. \"Andy, do ... do you think it's ...\nwell, an enemy?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I just don't know.\"\n  \n \n  For a long moment he sat there, trying to draw strength from her,\npunishing his brain for the glimmer of an idea. Finally, shaking his\nhead, he pushed back into his chair and reached for the sheaf of\npapers.\n  \n \n  \"We've got to find a clue—a trend—an inkling of something.\" He\nnodded toward the outer office. \"Stop all in-coming calls. Get those\ngirls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country.\nHave them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up\nanother relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and\nsandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and\noccupation of the victims. You and I'll start with Washington.\"\n  \n \n  Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode\nfrom the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on\nthe phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone\nand directory.\n  \n \n  He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to\nworried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical\nnurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible\nscrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm.

His gray eyes carry disapproval and irritation in them. As a member of the brass, the colonel strives for everything to be official and approved of, unlike the sergeant’s recent promotion. The replacement for the retired colonel had not yet arrived, and the chicken colonel is not thrilled. To have a noncom, defined as a noncommissioned officer, in charge of this office while in the midst of a national epidemic is ludicrous, in his eyes. \n\tDespite voicing his doubts and grievances, Sergeant Andy is allowed to continue working as the head-of-office, at least for the time being. The colonel steals away and plots his next move. \n\tSeveral hours later, he returns, this time with two officers in tow. He walks into Sergeant Andy’s office where he and Corporal Bettijean were looking through a stack of papers. With a defiant stride, the colonel tosses a newspaper onto the Sergeant’s desk. Andy reads it and quickly throws it across the room. The article tells the tale of a red plague taking over America, a possible plot from Russia, and baffled government officials. The colonel brought in the article--and possibly helped write it--to convey the seriousness of the situation, but Andy takes it as an offense instead. \n\tHis colleague, Corporal Bettijean, defends Andy and reprimands the colonel at the same time. The captain behind him scolds her in return. After Sergeant Andy recites a list of excuses for his office, the colonel tells him that his insubordination will not be allowed. He calls for his removal, as well as Corporal Bettijean's, and promotes the two officers from the surgeon general’s office to take their positions. \n\tAfter some fight, Andy relents and stands up, releasing himself of his duty.

After Andy is able to work through some reports with Bettiejean, the colonel returns to throw a newspaper on Andy’s desk to show the headlines, proving that the public panic has started. In this very tense encounter, the colonel continued to insist that Andy needed to understand the gravity of the situation, without recognizing that of course Andy knew that the issue was serious. He and a young captain overreacted to Bettiejean trying to calm the situation, citing insubordination, and the colonel tries to relieve Andy and Bettiejean of their duties before he is interrupted by a general. This general then assigns the colonel to report to Andy and Bettiejean for the remainder of the crisis, which makes the colonel even more upset. Near the end of the story, after the lab has a report about the toxin on the stamps, the colonel is already trying to take charge again. He reaches for Andy’s phone to start making calls even though Andy is the one in charge of the office, and is the point-person for the epidemic.

The fact that Andy is a noncommissioned officer operating without direct commissioned officer oversight is unacceptable to him.\n\nWhile the brigadier general sees Andy's expertise and places him in charge of the investigation, the chicken colonel immediately acts to try to undermine Andy's command.

The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\n  \n \n  Hyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas.

But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\n  \n \n  He let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\n  \n \n  He hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild.

He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\n  \n \n  He had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses—monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor—had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\n  \n \n  Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\n  \n \n  The main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\n  \n \n  The gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter—hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment—came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\n  \n \n  Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\n  \n \n  When his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\n  \n \n  He poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\n  \n \n  A woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\n  \n \n  He reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\n  \n \n  This was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be.

But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\n  \n \n  The man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\n  \n \n  Both would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\n  \n \n  Hyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\n\n[Chapter: Saboteur_of_Space_3]\nAll at once, Mury came to a stop, and swung around to face him\nsquarely, hard eyes compelling. They were on an overpass, not far\nfrom where the vast, almost wholly deserted offices of the Triplanet\nFreighting Company sprawled over a square mile of city. A half-smile\ntwisted Mury's thin lips.\n  \n \n  \"Don't misunderstand me, Ryd—you mean nothing at all to me as an\nindividual. But you're one of a vast mass of men for whom I am\nworking—the billions caught in the net of a corrupt government and\nsold as an economic prey to the ruthless masters of Mars. This, after\nthey've borne all the hardships of a year of embargo, have offered\ntheir hands willingly to the rebuilding of decadent Earth, only to\nbe refused by the weak leaders who can neither defy the enemy nor\ncapitulate frankly to him.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was dazed. His mind had never been constructed to cope with such\nideas and the past few years had not improved its capabilities. \"Are\nyou talking about the power cylinder?\" he demanded blurrily.\n  \n \n  Mury cast a glance toward the Milky Way as if to descry the Martian\ncargo projectile somewhere up among its countless lights. He said\nsimply, \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't get it,\" mumbled Ryd, frowning. He found words that he had\nheard somewhere a day or so before, in some bar or flophouse: \"The\npower cylinder is going to be the salvation of Earth. It's a shot in\nthe arm—no, right in the heart of Earth industry, here in Dynamopolis.\nIt will turn the wheels and light the cities and—\"\n  \n \n  \"To hell with that!\" snapped Mury, suddenly savage. His hands came up\nslightly, the fingers flexing; then dropped back to his sides. \"Don't\nyou know you're repeating damnable lies?\"\n  \n \n  Ryd could only stare, cringing and bewildered. Mury went on with a\npassion shocking after his smooth calm:\n  \n \n  \"The power shell is aid, yes—but with what a price! It's the thirty\npieces of silver for which the venal fools who rule our nations have\nsold the whole planet to Mars. Because they lack the courage and\nvision to retool Earth's plants and factories for the inescapable\nconflict, they're selling us out—making Earth, the first home of man,\na colony of the Red Planet. Do you know what Earth is to the great\nMartian land-owners?\n   \n   Do you?\n   \n  \" He paused out of breath; then finished\nvenomously, \"Earth is a great pool of labor ready to be tapped, cheaper\nthan robots—cheap as\n   \n   slaves\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  \"What about it?\" gulped Ryd, drawing away from the fanatic. \"What you\nwant\n   \n   me\n   \n  to do about it?\"\n  \n \n  Mury took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders. His face was\nonce more bleakly impassive; only the mouth was an ugly line. \"We're\ngoing to do something about it, you and I. Tonight. Now.\"\n  \n \n  Ryd was nearly sober. And wholly terrified. He got out chokingly,\n\"What's that mean?\"\n  \n \n  \"The power shell—isn't coming in as planned.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't do that.\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   We\n   \n  can,\" said Mury with a heavy accent on the first word. \"And there\nare fifty thousand credits in it for you, Ryd. Are you with us?\"\n  \n \n  Suspicion was chill reality now in Ryd's mind. And he knew one thing\ncertainly—if he refused now to accompany Mury, he would be killed, by\nthis man or another of his kind. For the secret power known only as\n   \n   We\n   \n  never took chances. Whispered-of, terrible, and world-embracing,\ndesperate upshot of the times in its principles of dynamitism, war, and\npanclasm—that was\n   \n   We\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  The question hung in the air for a long moment. Then Ryd, with\nan effort, said, \"Sure.\" A moment later it struck him that the\nmonosyllabic assent was suspicious; he added quickly, \"I got nothing to\nlose, see?\" It was, he realized, the cold truth.\n  \n \n  \"You won't lose,\" said Mury. He seemed to relax. But the menace with\nwhich he had clothed himself clung, as he turned back on the way they\nhad come.\n  \n \n  Ryd followed dog-like, his feet in their worn shoes moving without his\nvolition. He was frightened. Out of his very fright came a longing to\nplacate Mury, assure him that he, Ryd, was on the same side whatever\nhappened....\n  \n \n  After some steps he stole a sidelong glance at his tall companion, and\nwhined, \"Where ... where we going now?\"\n  \n \n  Mury paused in his long stride, removed a hand from a pocket of the\ngray topcoat that wrapped him as in somber thoughts. Wordlessly, he\npointed as Ryd had known he would—toward where a pale man-made dawn\nseemed breaking over Pi Mesa.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"One blow for freedom!\" said Mury with caught breath. His voice fell\nupon air scarcely stilled since the sodden thump of the blow that had\nkilled the guard.\n  \n \n  The body lay between them, face down on the graveled way in the inky\nmoon-shadow. On one side Pi Mesa stretched away two hundred yards to\ndrop sharply into the night; on the other was the unlighted mass of the\nlong, continuous, low buildings that housed now unused fuel pumps and\nservicing equipment. Looking down at the dead huddle at his feet, a\nlittle stunned by the reality of this, Ryd knew that he was in it now.\nHe was caught in the machinery.\n  \n \n  Mury hefted the length of steel in his hand once more, as if testing\nthe weight that had crushed a man's skull so easily. Then, with a short\nwrist-flip, he sent it flying into the dried weeds which had over-grown\nthe aero field on the mesa's rim during the summer months after State\norder had grounded all fliers in America.\n  \n \n  \"All right, Ryd,\" he said coolly. \"Trade clothes with this fellow. I've\nbrought you this far—you're taking me the rest of the way.\"\n  \n \n  The rest of the way.\n  \n \n  Ryd was still panting, and his side was paining from the strenuous\nexertion of the long climb up the side of the mountain, far from the\nguarded highway. His fingers, numbed by the cold of the high, thin air,\nshook as he knelt and fumbled with the zippers of the dead guard's\nuniform. The belted gun, however, was heavy and oddly comforting as\nhe clumsily buckled it about his hips. He knew enough of weapons\nto recognize this as, not the usual paralyzer, but a flame pistol,\npowerful and deadly. He let his hand linger on its butt; then strong\nfingers tightened on his bony wrist, and he looked up with a start into\nthe sardonic black eyes of the Panclast.\n  \n \n  \"No use now for firearms,\" said Mury. \"All the guns we could carry\nwouldn't help us if we were caught out there. That gun is just a\nstage property for the little play we're going to give in about three\nminutes—when you'll act a guardsman escorting me, a Poligerent of\nDynamopolis, aboard the towship\n   \n   Shahrazad\n   \n  .\"\n  \n \n  For a moment Ryd felt relief—he had hazily imagined that Mury's hatred\nof Mars and all things Martian might have led him to try to sabotage\nthe Martian warship which lay somewhere on the runways beyond the long,\nlow buildings, and which would be closely guarded. But the towship\nwould also be guarded ... he shivered in the cold, dry night air.\n  \n \n  Mury had melted into the shadow a few yards away. There was a light\nscraping, then a green flame sputtered, briefly lighting up his hands\nand face, and narrowing at once to a thin, singing needle of light.\nHe had turned a pocket electron torch against the lock-mechanism of a\nsmall, disused metal door.\n  \n \n \n \n  Ryd watched in painful suspense. There was no sound in his ears save\nfor the hard, dry shrilling of the ray as it bit into the steel. It\nseemed to be crying:\n   \n   run, run\n   \n  —but he remembered the power that knew\nhow to punish better than the law, and stood still, shivering.\n  \n \n  The lock gave way and the door slipped aside. A light went on inside,\nand Ryd's heart stopped, backfired, and started again, raggedly. The\nsame automatic mechanism that had turned the lights on had started the\nair-fresher, which picked up speed with a soft whine, sweeping out the\nlong-stale atmosphere. Mury motioned to Ryd to follow him in.\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_3]\nHe let the\n  thought run\naround through his head, savoring\nit with mental taste buds.\nHe would not kill her tonight. No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\n  \n \n  It was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\n  \n \n  He snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\n  \n \n  He settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\n  \n \n  He knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him—his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name—streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\n  \n \n  He thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch.\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_5]\nHe looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\n  \n \n  Sudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\n  \n \n  Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before—a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself—and complete consciousness—back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\n  \n \n  A waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\n  \n \n  The whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\n  \n \n  They began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\n  \n \n  His arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\n  \n \n  Half way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\n  \n \n  His arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n  \n \n  \"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n  \n \n  \"You know it!\"\n  \n \n  He began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\n  \n \n  Yes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\n  \n \n  He stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\n  \n \n  She drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\n  \n \n  His heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand....\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_6]\nShe sipped\n  her champagne\nslowly and provocatively across\nthe table from him. Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\n  \n \n  He wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\n  \n \n  Deep depression laid hold of\nhim. He would not be able to see\nher after tonight until he received\nhis monthly dole two weeks hence.\nShe wouldn't wait that long. Someone\nelse would have her.\n  \n \n  Unless ...\n  \n \n  Yes, he knew now that he was\ngoing to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It\nwould be a simple matter. With the\naid of the telporter suit, he could\nestablish an iron-clad alibi.\n  \n \n  He took a long drink of whiskey\nand looked at the dancers about\nhim. Sight of their gay costumes\nheightened his depression. He was\nwearing a cheap suit of satin, all he\ncould afford. But some day soon he\nwould show them! Some time soon\nhe would be dressed as gaily....\n  \n \n  \"Something troubling you,\nhoney?\"\n  \n \n  His gaze shot back to her and\nshe blurred slightly before his eyes.\n\"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned\na sickly smile and clutched\nher hand in his. \"Come on. Let's\ndance.\"\n  \n \n  He drew her from the chair and\ninto his arms. She melted toward\nhim as if desiring to become a part\nof him. A tremor of excitement\nsurged through him and threatened\nto turn his knees into quivering\njelly. He could not make his\nfeet conform to the flooding\nrhythm of the music. He half stumbled,\nhalf pushed her along past the\nbooths.\n  \n \n  In the shelter of the palms he\ndrew her savagely to him. \"Let's—let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little\nmore than a croak.\n  \n \n  \"But, honey!\" She pushed herself\naway, her low voice maddening\nhim. \"Don't you have a private\nroom? A girl doesn't like to be\ntaken outside....\"\n  \n \n  Her words bit into his brain like\nthe blade of a hot knife.\n  \n \n  No, he didn't have a private\nroom at the club like the others. A\nprivate room for his telporter receiver,\na private room where he\ncould take a willing guest. No! He\ncouldn't afford it! No!\n   \n   No!\n   \n  NO!\nHis lot was a cheap suit of satin!\nCheap whiskey! Cheap champagne!\nA cheap shack by the\nriver....\n  \n \n  An inarticulate cry escaped his\ntwisted lips. He clutched her roughly\nto him and dragged her through\nthe door and into the moonlight,\nwhiskey and anger lending him\nbrutal strength.\n  \n \n  He pulled her through the deserted\ngarden.\n   \n   All the others had\nprivate rooms!\n   \n  He pulled her to\nthe far end, behind a clump of\nsquatty firs. His hands clawed at\nher. He tried to smother her mouth\nwith kisses.\n  \n \n  She eluded him deftly. \"But,\n   \n   honey\n   \n  !\" Her voice had gone deeper\ninto her throat. \"I just want to be\nsure about things. If you can't afford\none of the private rooms—if\nyou can't afford to show me a good\ntime—if you can't come here real\noften ...\"\n  \n \n  The whiskey pounded and\nthrobbed at his brain like blows\nfrom an unseen club.

The husband, Herbert Hyrel, figures she is watching a sex-opera as her escapist entertainment of choice, and waits a few minutes to start his own entertainment. As we waits, he considers his anger towards his wife: he no longer resented the time she spent not talking to him, while utilizing her telovis, but he did hate that she controlled the purse-strings in the household and gave him a small allowance. His anger had been pent up for some time, enough that he wanted to kill his wife, but for now he was satisfied with the idea of killing her. Once enough time had passed, he flicked a switch on the teleporter suit he was wearing and a version of his body appeared in a cabin in the woods that he was renting, where he had left himself a fresh outfit. He headed to the Riverside Club where he hoped to encounter a woman he had met recently, and when he got there he sat down and drank some cheap whiskey. He encountered a costumed woman who teased him, pulled away to dance with someone else, but came back to dance with him once the man she was with disappeared.  This man had flipped the switch on his suit, disappearing and leaving behind a pile of clothes, presumably because he would have been discovered wherever his original body was. As Herbert danced and moved outside, he spotted the woman he had been looking for, wearing a suggestive costume and a platinum wig, her body and her purse all covered in jewels. She asked him for champagne, which he was upset about because he did not have much money, but he obliged and tried to move the night forward after he had had something to drink. Again, though, she requested he spend more money on her--this time, for a private room at the club so they did not have to be outside. She said she was asking him to prove to her that she could be spoiled, but this pressure reminded him how angry he was that he had to spend the little money he had trying to escape from his wife, budgeting in a way that limited his nights out just to have some privacy. He started yelling about how he would have more money soon, and eventually admitted that he would kill his wife to get it. Hearing this, the woman he was with pulled a gun out of her purse and shot him--it was his wife all along. The scene jumps back to the house, where the wife pulls off her telovis set, smugly turns off her husband's teleporter suit, and watches him gasp for air and die. She called the police to call for a doctor, hid her own teleporter suit, and waited for the police to show.", "Herbert Hyrel finds himself in a loveless and difficult marriage. His wife has withdrawn herself, sticking to her televois or 3-D TV, and only gives him a monthly allowance. Her generational wealth makes him feel emasculated and weak, which only strengthens his hatred for her. Hyrel has recently invested in a teleporter suit, one that took him six months of saving to put the down payment on. This suit allows him to leave his corporeal body and travel to a shadow realm, where his conscious spirit can roam free. He uses this to drink, party, meet women, and escape from his wife and true reality. \nHe’s looking forward to traveling again, because of the woman he met last time in the flapper outfit. He hopes that this night will be the night she gives herself to him. After soaking in the wonderful thoughts of murdering his wife--which he plans to do as soon as the thought no longer brings him joy--Hyrel flicks the switch on his teleporter suit and arrives naked in a small cabin. Quickly, he changes into his cheap satin suit and makes his way to Riverside Club by taking the bus and walking. Once there, he orders a bottle of cheap whiskey, thanks to his depleting funds, and watches the masked dancers around him. A woman in a Persian-themed costume kisses him on the cheek but leaves him for another man. That man suddenly disappears, leaving only his costume behind. Hyrel reveals that those who get hurt in the shadow realm carry the hurt back with them in the real world. For example, he cut his hand in Riverside Club, and the pain traveled with him, but not the scar. \nThe Persian dancer joins him again, and they start to leave the club. He’s drawn to another woman the same from the night before. He swaps ladies and dances with her instead. She asks for champagne, which he reluctantly purchases. \nThey drink, and then he forces her out of the club. Feeling less-than, he forces himself on her, trying to kiss and grope her. She keeps asking him if he has enough money for her, where his private room is, and if he’ll be coming back soon. This only emasculates him more and he soon explodes, telling her that he’s going to kill his wife so he can finally have her money and do what he wants. \nThe flapper pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head and brain. She flicks the switch, and Mrs. Hyrel wakes up in her chair. She flicks the switch on Herbert, and he comes back in a vegetative state since his body brought back the pain, but not the scar.

Herbert despises the way his wife looks at him, and he imagines her denigrating him as a gold-digger with nothing to offer a woman, so he privately purchases a telporter suit--a thin, mesh body cover that can be worn under one's clothes and is used to transport the wearer's \"shadowy self\" to a receiver previously set in secret. While he believes his wife is watching a sex-opera using her telovis (a 3-D imaging device), Herbert engages the telporter and transports himself to a cabin situated between a highway and a river. There, he changes clothes and walks to the Riverside Club (a place where owners of telporter suits can gather to escape their dreary outer lives) where he plans to meet a girl he had met the previous night. Because telporting oneself is illegal, rooms at the club are very expensive in order to cover the costs of police protection and Herbert cannot afford a private room there with the allowance his wife gives him. The club is colorful and full of costumed, masked partyers, dancing together and drinking champagne. Herbert purchases a bottle of whiskey because he cannot afford the expensive champagne. As Herbert drinks, he becomes more relaxed and confident, and he watches a woman dressed in a Persian costume dancing with a man dressed as a bullfighter. Soon after, the bullfighter disappears, and Herbert is reminded that sometimes people at the club vanish suddenly when there is a threat they will be discovered in their outer lives. He also notices a scar on his hand and is reminded that when someone's shadow self is injured, their outer husk retains the feeling of pain but not the scar. Herbert dances with the Persian-costumed woman and becomes steadily more intoxicated by drink and by the atmosphere of revelry. Eventually, he finds the girl he had met the night before, recognizing her by her long, stockinged legs. She wears a platinum wig, a white mask, and green contact lenses, and they dance together and kiss. The drunker Herbert becomes, the more insecure he feels about his ability to satisfy the woman, and he begins lashing out at her, accidentally revealing his plans to kill his wife in order to take her money so he can start a new life with the mysterious woman. The woman laughs at him, and she withdraws a gun from her purse and shoots Herbert twice--once in the heart and then in the head. The woman is actually Mrs. Herbert Hyrel, and she has been using her own telporter suit to expose Herbert and dispose of him herself. Because Herbert’s gunshot wounds do not transfer with his shadowy self back to his outer body, it appears as if Herbert simply died. Mrs. Herbert Hyrel calls the police, hides the telporter suits, and awaits their arrival.", "Herbert Hyrel and his wife have an unhappy marriage. Herbert hates his wife and feels as if she thinks she is better than he is. She has money but only gives him a small allowance, and he resents her for this. She isn’t fond of him either. Every night, she puts on her telovis for about three hours. Herbert thinks she is watching black-market sex-operas. Once she is caught up in the program, he uses his teleporter suit to escape to the Riverside Club. This is an exclusive club for people with teleporter suits, money, and a desire for self-abandonment. People go there to escape their boring, unpleasant lives and wear costumes to hide their identities while they engage in drunken, sexually-abandoned activities. Herbert has met a girl there and wants to see her again. He looks for her when he first arrives but doesn’t see her, so he is interested in a Persian dancing girl who flirts with him. She is with a man dressed as a toreador. Herbert catches a glimpse of the scar on his hand where he had cut it at the club three weeks ago. In his unteleported body, he feels the pain of the cut but has no cut. \n\tLater in the evening, the toreador disappears from the dance floor, leaving behind a pool of his clothes. This means that he had to teleport back to his real life immediately; it is something that has happened many times at the club. Emboldened by his whiskey, Herbert moves in and embraces the Persian dancing girl. He draws her toward the exit to the gardens when he sees a long leg wearing a black mesh stocking protruding from a private booth. That is what the girl from the previous evening was wearing. He pulls the stockinged girl from the booth and dances with her. The stockinged girl is wearing a can-can dancer costume. She insists on having a glass of champagne before Herbert takes her outside. While she drinks, he worries that he won’t be able to see her again until he gets his next allowance in two weeks and that she will find someone else in the meantime. He decides that he is going to kill his wife so he can have her money. When he tries to take the girl outside, she resists. She lets him know she wants him to have the money for a private room, show her a good time, and come see her often. He tells her he’ll have plenty of money after tonight and that he will kill his wife to get it. The dancer pulls a gun from her purse and shoots him. \n\tMrs. Hyrel removes her telovis and pushes Herbert’s teleport button to bring him back. His eyes open, and then he dies. She calls the police, saying something horrible has happened to her husband. Then she changes clothes, removing her teleporter suit, and hiding it behind a hidden door at the back of the medicine cabinet.\n"]}}

He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\n  \n \n  He had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses—monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor—had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\n  \n \n  Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\n  \n \n  The main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\n  \n \n  The gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter—hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment—came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\n  \n \n  Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\n  \n \n  When his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\n  \n \n  He poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\n  \n \n  A woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\n  \n \n  He reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\n  \n \n  This was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\n  \n \n  The Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\n  \n \n  The man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\n  \n \n  Both would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\n  \n \n  Hyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\n\n[Chapter: The_Girls_From_Fieu_Dayol_5]\nThe chimes sounded again. He opened the door.\n  \n \n  She walked in with a demure, \"Hello.\" He took her wrap. When he saw\nwhat she was wearing he had to tilt his head back so that his eyes\nwouldn't fall out of their sockets.\n  \n \n  Skin, mostly, in the upper regions. White, glowing skin on which her\nlong hair lay like forest pools. As for her dress, it was as though\nshe had fallen forward into immaculate snow, half-burying her breasts\nbefore catching herself on her elbows, then turning into a sitting\nposition, the snow clinging to her skin in a glistening veneer;\narising finally to her feet, resplendently attired.\n  \n \n  He went over to the sideboard, picked up the bottle of bourbon. She\nfollowed. He set the two snifter glasses side by side and tilted the\nbottle. \"Say when.\" \"When!\" \"I admire your dress—never saw anything\nquite like it.\" \"Thank you. The material is something new. Feel it.\"\n\"It's—it's almost like foam rubber. Cigarette?\" \"Thanks.... Is\nsomething wrong, Mr. Quidley?\" \"No, of course not. Why?\" \"Your hands\nare trembling.\" \"Oh. I'm—I'm afraid it's the present company, Miss\nSmith.\" \"Call me Kay.\"\n  \n \n  They touched glasses: \"Your liquor is as exquisite as your living room,\nHerbert. I shall have to come here more often.\" \"I hope you will, Kay.\"\n\"Though such conduct, I'm told, is morally reprehensible on the planet\nEarth.\" \"Not in this particular circle. Your hair is lovely.\" \"Thank\nyou.... You haven't mentioned my perfume yet. Perhaps I'm standing too\nfar away.... There!\" \"It's—it's as lovely as your hair, Kay.\" \"Um,\nkiss me again.\" \"I—I never figured—I mean, I engaged a caterer to\nserve us dinner at 9:30.\" \"Call him up. Make it 10:30.\"\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_8]\nMrs. Herbert Hyrel\n  removed\nthe telovis from her\nhead and laid it carefully aside.\nShe uncoiled her long legs from beneath\nher, walked to her husband's\nchair, and stood for a long moment\nlooking down at him, her lips\ndrawn back in contempt. Then she\nbent over him and reached down\nhis thigh until her fingers contacted\nthe small switch.\n  \n \n  Seconds later, a slight tremor\nshook Hyrel's body. His eyes\nsnapped open, air escaped his lungs,\nhis lower jaw sagged inanely, and\nhis head lolled to one side.\n  \n \n  She stood a moment longer,\nwatching his eyes become glazed\nand sightless. Then she walked to\nthe telephone.\n  \n \n  \"Police?\" she said. \"This is Mrs.\nHerbert Hyrel. Something horrible\nhas happened to my husband.\nPlease come over immediately.\nBring a doctor.\"\n  \n \n  She hung up, went to her bathroom,\nstripped off her clothing,\nand slid carefully out of her telporter\nsuit. This she folded neatly\nand tucked away into the false back\nof the medicine cabinet. She found\na fresh pair of blue, plastifur pajamas\nand got into them.\n  \n \n  She was just arriving back into\nthe living room, tying the cord of\nher dressing gown about her slim\nwaist, when she heard the sound of\nthe police siren out front.\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n \n   Transcriber's Note:\n   \n \n \n  This etext was produced from\n   \n   If Worlds of Science Fiction\n   \n  July 1953.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\n  \n \n  It was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\n  \n \n  He snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\n  \n \n  He settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\n  \n \n  He knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him—his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name—streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\n  \n \n  He thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch.\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_1]\nA grim tale of a future in which everyone is desperate to escape\nreality, and a hero who wants to have his wine and drink it, too.\n   \n \n \n  A BOTTLE OF\n   \n \n   Old Wine\n   \n \n \n  By Richard O. Lewis\n  \n \n  Illustrated by KELLY FREAS\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_5]\nHe looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\n  \n \n  Sudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\n  \n \n  Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before—a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself—and complete consciousness—back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\n  \n \n  A waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\n  \n \n  The whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\n  \n \n  They began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\n  \n \n  His arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\n  \n \n  Half way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\n  \n \n  His arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n  \n \n  \"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n  \n \n  \"You know it!\"\n  \n \n  He began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\n  \n \n  Yes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\n  \n \n  He stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\n  \n \n  She drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\n  \n \n  His heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand....\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_2]\nHerbert Hyrel\n  settled himself\nmore comfortably in his\neasy chair, extended his short legs\nfurther toward the fireplace, and let\nhis eyes travel cautiously in the general\ndirection of his wife.\n  \n \n  She was in her chair as usual, her\nlong legs curled up beneath her,\nthe upper half of her face hidden\nin the bulk of her personalized,\nthree-dimensional telovis. The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\n  \n \n  Hyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas. In any event,\nthere would be no sound, movement,\nor sign of life from her for\nthe next three hours. To break the\nthread of the play for even a moment\nwould ruin all the previous\nemotional build-up.\n  \n \n  There had been a time when he\nhated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during\nwhich he was completely ignored.\nIt was different now, however, for\nthose hours furnished him with\ntime for an escape of his own.\n  \n \n  His lips curled into a tight smile\nand his right hand fondled the unobtrusive\nswitch beneath his trouser\nleg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes\nlonger. But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\n  \n \n  He let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\n  \n \n  He hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every\nglance and gesture, \"I made a bad\nbargain when I married you. You\nwanted me, my money, everything,\nand had nothing to give in return\nexcept your own doltish self. You\nset a trap for me, baited with lies\nand a false front. Now you are\ncaught in your own trap and will\nremain there like a mouse to eat\nfrom my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\n  \n \n  But some day his hate would be\nappeased. Yes, some day soon he\nwould kill her!\n  \n \n  He shot a sideways glance at her,\nwondering if by chance she suspected.... She\nhadn't moved. Her\nlips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably\nreached one of its more pleasurable\nmoments.\n  \n \n  Hyrel let his eyes shift back to\nthe fireplace again. Yes, he would\nkill her. Then he would claim\na rightful share of her money, be\nrid of her debasing dominance.\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_7]\nShe had gone\n  coldly rigid in\nhis arms, unyielding.\n  \n \n  Madness added to the pounding\nin his brain. Tears welled into his\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"I'll show you! I'll kill her! Then\nI'll have money!\" The hands\nclutching her shoulders shook her\ndrunkenly. \"You wait here! I'll go\nhome and kill her now! Then I'll\nbe back!\"\n  \n \n  \"Silly boy!\" Her low laughter\nrang hollowly in his ears. \"And just\nwho is it you are going to kill?\"\n  \n \n  \"My wife!\" he cried. \"My wife!\nI'll ...\"\n  \n \n  A sudden sobering thought\nstruck him. He was talking too\nmuch. And he wasn't making sense.\nHe shouldn't be telling her this.\nAnyway, he couldn't get the money\ntonight even if he did kill his wife.\n  \n \n  \"And so you are going to kill\nyour wife....\"\n  \n \n  He blinked the tears from his\neyes. His chest was heaving, his\nheart pounding. He looked at her\nshimmering form. \"Y-yes,\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  Her eyes glinted strangely in the\nlight of the moon. Her handbag\nglinted as she opened it, and something\nshe took from it glittered\ncoldly in her hand.\n  \n \n  \"Fool!\"\n  \n \n  The first shot tore squarely\nthrough his heart. And while he\nstood staring at her, mouth agape,\na second shot burned its way\nthrough his bewildered brain.\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_6]\nShe sipped\n  her champagne\nslowly and provocatively across\nthe table from him. Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\n  \n \n  He wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\n  \n \n  Deep depression laid hold of\nhim. He would not be able to see\nher after tonight until he received\nhis monthly dole two weeks hence.\nShe wouldn't wait that long. Someone\nelse would have her.\n  \n \n  Unless ...\n  \n \n  Yes, he knew now that he was\ngoing to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It\nwould be a simple matter. With the\naid of the telporter suit, he could\nestablish an iron-clad alibi.\n  \n \n  He took a long drink of whiskey\nand looked at the dancers about\nhim. Sight of their gay costumes\nheightened his depression. He was\nwearing a cheap suit of satin, all he\ncould afford. But some day soon he\nwould show them! Some time soon\nhe would be dressed as gaily....\n  \n \n  \"Something troubling you,\nhoney?\"\n  \n \n  His gaze shot back to her and\nshe blurred slightly before his eyes.\n\"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned\na sickly smile and clutched\nher hand in his. \"Come on. Let's\ndance.\"\n  \n \n  He drew her from the chair and\ninto his arms. She melted toward\nhim as if desiring to become a part\nof him. A tremor of excitement\nsurged through him and threatened\nto turn his knees into quivering\njelly. He could not make his\nfeet conform to the flooding\nrhythm of the music. He half stumbled,\nhalf pushed her along past the\nbooths.\n  \n \n  In the shelter of the palms he\ndrew her savagely to him. \"Let's—let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little\nmore than a croak.\n  \n \n  \"But, honey!\" She pushed herself\naway, her low voice maddening\nhim. \"Don't you have a private\nroom? A girl doesn't like to be\ntaken outside....\"\n  \n \n  Her words bit into his brain like\nthe blade of a hot knife.\n  \n \n  No, he didn't have a private\nroom at the club like the others.

She is a fan of her telovis set, her preferred medium for escapist entertainment, and Herbert is under the impression that she likes to watch sex-operas, which are a longer experience that rely on emotional build-up. She makes most of the money but also controls it all, which Herbert resents her for--he thinks she is keeping it from him, and feels looked down upon when she gives him his allowance. This infantilizing attitude makes him extremely angry. She is devious and cunning, and hatches a plan to catch him in his act. It is her, after all, that drove him to want to escape.

", "Mrs. Herbert Hyrel is the daughter of a wealthy family. Although she and Herbert most likely originally married for love, their relationship quickly spiraled out of control and soon their disparity in wealth became a pressing issue. \nMrs. Hyrel withdrew herself from her husband once she felt that he was only with her for her money. She allotted him a monthly allowance, but that was all. Since Herbert was not the breadwinner, he felt emasculated and out of control in his own home. She is the instigator for his violent fantasies of killing her, and the woman that draws him back to Riverside Club. \nHer jewel-studded flapper dress that reveals her legs reveals her wealth and status at the Riverside Club. She wears green contacts and a platinum wig to further disguise herself from Herbert. Despite being married, he fails to recognize her, and, after tempting him and berating him, he reveals to her his plans to murder his wife. She then murders him in the shadow realm, killing his soul there but leaving his corporeal body intact in the real world. After traveling back to their home, Mrs. Herbert Hyrel supposedly gets away with the murder by pretending to be the doting wife concerned for her husband’s health. She also has a rock-solid alibi with the televois and the fact that Hyrel was in an illegal teleporter suit. \n", "Mrs. Herbert Hyrel is a strong, financially independent woman loathed by her husband because he feels she considers him less of a man because of his reliance upon her. At the beginning of the story, she wears a telovis--a device used to render 3-D images of remote performances in one's own living room. Herbert suspects she is using the device to watch a sex-opera, and that explains the slight smile on her face as he watches her. In reality, she is likely smiling because she is confident in her plan to catch Herbert at the Riverside Club and kill him there. Mrs. Hyrel provides Herbert a small allowance, which he saves up to purchase his own telporter suit, not knowing that she also has one. Mrs. Hyrel uses Herbert's tendency toward fantasy as an advantage in her plot against him. She takes on the persona of the mysterious woman, wearing a white mask, green contact lenses, and a platinum blonde wig. She seduces Herbert, and eventually kills him when he admits his plot to her. She knows she will get away with his murder because once his shadowy self transfers back into his body, there will be no visible wounds.", "Herbert’s wife is the can-can girl that he met at the Riverside Club the night before, but he doesn’t recognize her. She detests Herbert and resents having to give him some of her money. She acts as if he tricked her into marrying him and now treats him like an irresponsible child. Every night, she escapes from him when she puts on her telovis and watches shows for three hours. The night in the story, we learn that she actually teleports to the Riverside Club, too. At the club the night before, she met Herbert and flirted with him so much that he couldn’t wait to see her again. When he goes to the club the night that the story takes place, he looks for her, finally finds her, and pulls her out of a booth to him. She wears a can-can dancer outfit that highlights her long legs. Herbert tries to take her outside immediately, but she insists on having champagne first. She drinks her champagne slowly while Herbert is anxious that he might have to teleport back. Herbert decides that he will go ahead and kill his wife, as he has been thinking about doing for quite some time. They dance, and then Herbert tries to pull her outside. Mrs. Hyrel asks if he doesn’t have a private room he can take her to. Frustrated, he drags her outside, but she pushes away from him and says she needs to know he can afford a private room, show her a good time, and come there often to see her. When he says he’ll have money after tomorrow night, she insists they will wait until then. Angry and desperate, Herbert vows he will kill his wife, and then he will have money. Mrs. Hyrel laughs and asks who he will kill, and he repeats it even though he realizes he shouldn’t. She removes a gun from her purse and shoots him in the heart and the head. She teleports back home, presses his teleporter button, and after he dies, she calls the police saying that something horrible has happened to her husband.

He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\n  \n \n  He had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses—monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor—had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\n  \n \n  Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\n  \n \n  The main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\n  \n \n  The gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter—hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment—came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\n  \n \n  Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\n  \n \n  When his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\n  \n \n  He poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\n  \n \n  A woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\n  \n \n  He reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\n  \n \n  This was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\n  \n \n  The Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\n  \n \n  The man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\n  \n \n  Both would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\n  \n \n  Hyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_5]\nHe looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\n  \n \n  Sudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\n  \n \n  Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before—a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself—and complete consciousness—back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\n  \n \n  A waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\n  \n \n  The whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\n  \n \n  They began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\n  \n \n  His arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\n  \n \n  Half way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\n  \n \n  His arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n  \n \n  \"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n  \n \n  \"You know it!\"\n  \n \n  He began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\n  \n \n  Yes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\n  \n \n  He stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\n  \n \n  She drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\n  \n \n  His heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand....\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_2]\nHerbert Hyrel\n  settled himself\nmore comfortably in his\neasy chair, extended his short legs\nfurther toward the fireplace, and let\nhis eyes travel cautiously in the general\ndirection of his wife.\n  \n \n  She was in her chair as usual, her\nlong legs curled up beneath her,\nthe upper half of her face hidden\nin the bulk of her personalized,\nthree-dimensional telovis. The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\n  \n \n  Hyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas. In any event,\nthere would be no sound, movement,\nor sign of life from her for\nthe next three hours. To break the\nthread of the play for even a moment\nwould ruin all the previous\nemotional build-up.\n  \n \n  There had been a time when he\nhated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during\nwhich he was completely ignored.\nIt was different now, however, for\nthose hours furnished him with\ntime for an escape of his own.\n  \n \n  His lips curled into a tight smile\nand his right hand fondled the unobtrusive\nswitch beneath his trouser\nleg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes\nlonger. But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\n  \n \n  He let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\n  \n \n  He hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every\nglance and gesture, \"I made a bad\nbargain when I married you. You\nwanted me, my money, everything,\nand had nothing to give in return\nexcept your own doltish self. You\nset a trap for me, baited with lies\nand a false front. Now you are\ncaught in your own trap and will\nremain there like a mouse to eat\nfrom my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\n  \n \n  But some day his hate would be\nappeased. Yes, some day soon he\nwould kill her!\n  \n \n  He shot a sideways glance at her,\nwondering if by chance she suspected.... She\nhadn't moved. Her\nlips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably\nreached one of its more pleasurable\nmoments.\n  \n \n  Hyrel let his eyes shift back to\nthe fireplace again. Yes, he would\nkill her. Then he would claim\na rightful share of her money, be\nrid of her debasing dominance.\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_8]\nMrs. Herbert Hyrel\n  removed\nthe telovis from her\nhead and laid it carefully aside.\nShe uncoiled her long legs from beneath\nher, walked to her husband's\nchair, and stood for a long moment\nlooking down at him, her lips\ndrawn back in contempt. Then she\nbent over him and reached down\nhis thigh until her fingers contacted\nthe small switch.\n  \n \n  Seconds later, a slight tremor\nshook Hyrel's body. His eyes\nsnapped open, air escaped his lungs,\nhis lower jaw sagged inanely, and\nhis head lolled to one side.\n  \n \n  She stood a moment longer,\nwatching his eyes become glazed\nand sightless. Then she walked to\nthe telephone.\n  \n \n  \"Police?\" she said. \"This is Mrs.\nHerbert Hyrel. Something horrible\nhas happened to my husband.\nPlease come over immediately.\nBring a doctor.\"\n  \n \n  She hung up, went to her bathroom,\nstripped off her clothing,\nand slid carefully out of her telporter\nsuit. This she folded neatly\nand tucked away into the false back\nof the medicine cabinet. She found\na fresh pair of blue, plastifur pajamas\nand got into them.\n  \n \n  She was just arriving back into\nthe living room, tying the cord of\nher dressing gown about her slim\nwaist, when she heard the sound of\nthe police siren out front.\n  \n \n  THE END\n  \n \n \n   Transcriber's Note:\n   \n \n \n  This etext was produced from\n   \n   If Worlds of Science Fiction\n   \n  July 1953.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

What, he asked himself, standing in the library aisle\nand staring at the indecipherable words, was a normal girl like Kay\ndoing in such a childish secret society? From the way she and her\ncorrespondents carried on you'd almost think they were Martian girl\nscouts on an interplanetary camping trip, trying for their merit badges\nin communications!\n  \n \n  You could hardly call Kay a girl scout, though.\n  \n \n  Nevertheless, she was the key figure in the\n   \n   snoll-doper\n   \n  enigma. The\nfact annoyed him, especially when he considered that a\n   \n   snoll doper\n   \n  ,\nfor all he knew, could be anything from a Chinese fortune cooky to an\nH-bomb.\n  \n \n  He remembered Kay's odd accent. Was that the way a person would speak\nEnglish if her own language ran something like \"\n   \n   ist ifedereret, hid\njestig snoll doper adwo\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  He remembered the way she had looked at him in the coffee bar.\n  \n \n  He remembered the material of her dress.\n  \n \n  He remembered how she had come to his room.\n  \n \n  \"I didn't know you had a taste for Taine.\"\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_3]\nHe let the\n  thought run\naround through his head, savoring\nit with mental taste buds.\nHe would not kill her tonight. No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\n  \n \n  It was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\n  \n \n  He snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\n  \n \n  He settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\n  \n \n  He knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him—his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name—streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\n  \n \n  He thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch.\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_7]\nShe had gone\n  coldly rigid in\nhis arms, unyielding.\n  \n \n  Madness added to the pounding\nin his brain.

She is absorbed in her \"telovis,\" a virtual reality device, which initially made Herbert feel lonely but now provides him with the opportunity for his own secret escape. This establishes a foundation of mutual isolation.\n\n##begin_quote##\nThere had been a time when he hated her for those long and silent evenings, lonely hours during which he was completely ignored. It was different now, however, for those hours furnished him with time for an escape of his own.\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 2: Herbert's feelings for his wife have evolved from resentment into a deep, violent hatred fueled by financial control.**\nHerbert's animosity is not just about being ignored; it is a \"deep, burning savagery.\" He feels infantilized and controlled by his wife, who holds all the financial power and gives him only a \"paltry allowance.\" This financial dependency is the primary source of his rage and his desire to kill her.\n\n##begin_quote##\nHe hated her with a deep, burning savagery that was deadly in its passion. He hated her for her money, the money she kept securely from him. He hated her for the paltry allowance she doled out to him, as if he were an irresponsible child.\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 3: The wife's feelings are revealed to be contemptuous and ruthless.**\nWhile Herbert's hatred is explicitly stated, his wife's feelings are shown through her actions. After killing his \"shadowy self\" at the club (while disguised as the can-can dancer), she returns to their home. Her reaction to his physical death is not one of shock or grief, but of pure contempt, confirming the complete absence of affection in their marriage.\n\n##begin_quote##\nMrs. Herbert Hyrel removed the telovis from her head... walked to her husband's chair, and stood for a long moment looking down at him, her lips drawn back in contempt.\n##end_quote##\n\n##Answer: The relationship between Herbert and his wife is toxic and devoid of affection, characterized by mutual escapism, deep resentment, and deadly deception. Herbert harbors a murderous hatred for his wife, primarily because she controls all the money and treats him like a child. Unbeknownst to him, his wife also leads a secret life and holds him in utter contempt, a feeling she confirms with a cold and calculated demeanor after she kills him to stop his own murder plot."}], "metadata": {"id": "272", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["The relationship Herbert and his wife have seems to have an infantilizing or patronizing tone to it. His wife seems to be fairly cold towards him, at least from the way she interacts with his death in the last scene of the story, but Herbert is harboring a large amount of hate and anger. A lot of this dynamic is driven by the control of money in the household, as Herbert's wife is in charge of these decisions, and Herbert does not agree with her on how much money he should have access to. His anger increases as he works on a plan to get away from her, as he spends what little he has to maintain access to the Riverside Club, paying rent on a cabin, buying a teleporter suit, and similar expenses. He is finally pushed to make the choice to finally want to kill her when he finds he does not have the spending money to be able to buy nice drinks or private rooms for himself and the woman he meets at the club, who turns out to be his wife. ", "Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Hyrel have a constant struggle for power within their domestic relationship. Mrs. Hyrel’s family wealth insults Herbert, seeing as he has none. When she comes to the realization that he may only be with her because of her money, she starts to hide it from him and only gives him a monthly allowance. At that moment, Mrs. Hyrel took control and took most of Herbert’s power away from him. \nIt’s clear that Hyrel wants to be the man of the relationship or the one that wears the pants. So this action made him feel weak and unimportant. This further aggravated their marriage and led to a build-up of long-term resentment. \nMrs. Hyrel practically ignores Herbert, spending her evenings watching the televois. She doesn’t want to be bothered during this time either, since it would ruin the show. It’s later revealed that she also has a teleporter suit, so she may have been in the Riverside Club in other instances, not just watching the televois. This power struggle and wealth inequity led to Herbert’s murderous fantasies and his eventual murder. \n", "The story never shows the Hyrels communicating outside of their shadowy selves; this emphasizes their dysfunction as a couple and highlights their mutual disdain. Herbert thinks his wife hates him because she believes he married her for her money, and he lives off the allowances she gives him. In turn, Herbert feels emasculated, and blames this on her, despite the fact that he does nothing but take her money and use it to attempt to seduce women at the Riverside Club. Herbert compares the thought of killing his wife to a bottle of old wine; the longer one marvels at a nice, expensive bottle of wine, the better it tastes when one finally drinks it. In the same way, he relishes his scheme, almost becoming intoxicated by it. When Herbert reunites with the woman at the Riverside Club, he cannot stop worrying that his wife will remove her telovis and discover him, and he continuously obsesses over his plan with increasing urgency. Herbert is so blinded by his rage and insecurities, that he fails to realize the woman is actually Mrs. Hyrel in disguise. ", "The Hyrels have an unhappy marriage. In the evenings, they escape from each other, Mrs. Hyrel to her telovis shows and he to the Riverside Club. Herbert first resented Mrs. Hyrel’s hours-long escape each night that left him lonely in the evenings, but then he gets his teleporter suit and can’t wait for her to get wrapped up in her shows so that he can escape to the club. His resentment of his wife grew into hatred. Herbert does not have money of his own; his wife has money and gives him a “paltry” allowance as if he were a child. She seems to resent him, too, because he thinks she feels like she got a bad deal in marrying him and that she was trapped into marrying him without knowing what he was really like. Herbert has been thinking of killing his wife for some time, but he doesn’t want to do it right away because thinking about it is like the anticipation of enjoying an old bottle of wine. As long as the bottle is there, he can enjoy the hope of drinking it just as he can enjoy the hope of killing his wife. Even in her altered identity as the can-can dancer at the club, Mrs. Hyrel treats Herbert as inferior. She refuses to let him take her outside until he has bought her a glass of champagne; then she makes him wait a long time while she sips it. When he finally does take her outside, she refuses to do what he wants unless he can show her he has the money for a private room and to entertain her properly. Mrs. Hyrel knows that this will frustrate him even more and probably suspected that he wanted to kill her. In any case, she has planned to kill him because she brought her gun with her. When he states that he will kill his wife to have the money to entertain the girl, Mrs. Hyrel promptly shoots him. Her plan is well-thought-out because she has a hidden back to her medicine cabinet where she hides her teleporter suit before the police come. This hidden compartment has allowed her to keep her visits to the Riverside Club from Herbert and will prevent the police from suspecting her role in Herbert’s death.\n\n"]}}

The telovis,\nof a stereoscopic nature, seemingly\nbrought the performers with\nall their tinsel and color directly\ninto the room of the watcher.\n  \n \n  Hyrel had no way of seeing into\nthe plastic affair she wore, but he\nguessed from the expression on the\nlower half of her face that she was\nwatching one of the newer black-market\nsex-operas. In any event,\nthere would be no sound, movement,\nor sign of life from her for\nthe next three hours. To break the\nthread of the play for even a moment\nwould ruin all the previous\nemotional build-up.\n  \n \n  There had been a time when he\nhated her for those long and silent\nevenings, lonely hours during\nwhich he was completely ignored.\nIt was different now, however, for\nthose hours furnished him with\ntime for an escape of his own.\n  \n \n  His lips curled into a tight smile\nand his right hand fondled the unobtrusive\nswitch beneath his trouser\nleg. He did not press the switch.\nHe would wait a few minutes\nlonger. But it was comforting to\nknow that it was there, exhilarating\nto know that he could escape\nfor a few hours by a mere flick of\nhis finger.\n  \n \n  He let his eyes stray to the dim\nlight of the artificial flames in the\nfireplace. His hate for her was not\nbounded merely by those lonely\nhours she had forced upon him.\nNo, it was far more encompassing.\n  \n \n  He hated her with a deep, burning\nsavagery that was deadly in its\npassion. He hated her for her\nmoney, the money she kept securely\nfrom him. He hated her for the\npaltry allowance she doled out to\nhim, as if he were an irresponsible\nchild. It was as if she were constantly\nreminding him in every\nglance and gesture, \"I made a bad\nbargain when I married you. You\nwanted me, my money, everything,\nand had nothing to give in return\nexcept your own doltish self. You\nset a trap for me, baited with lies\nand a false front. Now you are\ncaught in your own trap and will\nremain there like a mouse to eat\nfrom my hand whatever crumbs I\nstoop to give you.\"\n  \n \n  But some day his hate would be\nappeased. Yes, some day soon he\nwould kill her!\n  \n \n  He shot a sideways glance at her,\nwondering if by chance she suspected.... She\nhadn't moved. Her\nlips were pouted into a half smile;\nthe sex-opera had probably\nreached one of its more pleasurable\nmoments.\n  \n \n  Hyrel let his eyes shift back to\nthe fireplace again. Yes, he would\nkill her. Then he would claim\na rightful share of her money, be\nrid of her debasing dominance.\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_4]\nThe dank air\n  of the cabin\nwas chill to Herbert Hyrel's\nnaked flesh. He fumbled through\nthe darkness for the clothing he\nkept there, found his shorts and\ntrousers, got hurriedly into them,\nthen flicked on a pocket lighter and\nignited a stub of candle upon the\ntable. By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\n  \n \n  He had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses—monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor—had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\n  \n \n  Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\n  \n \n  The main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\n  \n \n  The gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter—hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment—came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\n  \n \n  Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\n  \n \n  When his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\n  \n \n  He poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\n  \n \n  A woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\n  \n \n  He reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\n  \n \n  This was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\n  \n \n  The Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\n  \n \n  The man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\n  \n \n  Both would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\n  \n \n  Hyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_6]\nShe sipped\n  her champagne\nslowly and provocatively across\nthe table from him. Her eyes sparkled\nbehind the almond slits of her\nmask, caught the color changes and\ncast them back. She was wearing\ncontact lenses of a garish green.\n  \n \n  He wished she would hurry with\nher drink. He had horrible visions\nof his wife at home taking off her\ntelovis and coming to his chair. He\nwould then have to press the\nswitch that would jerk his shadowy\nself back along its invisible connecting\ncord, jerk him back and\nleave but a small mound of clothes\nupon the chair at the table.\n  \n \n  Deep depression laid hold of\nhim. He would not be able to see\nher after tonight until he received\nhis monthly dole two weeks hence.\nShe wouldn't wait that long. Someone\nelse would have her.\n  \n \n  Unless ...\n  \n \n  Yes, he knew now that he was\ngoing to kill his wife as soon as the\nopportunity presented itself. It\nwould be a simple matter. With the\naid of the telporter suit, he could\nestablish an iron-clad alibi.\n  \n \n  He took a long drink of whiskey\nand looked at the dancers about\nhim. Sight of their gay costumes\nheightened his depression. He was\nwearing a cheap suit of satin, all he\ncould afford. But some day soon he\nwould show them! Some time soon\nhe would be dressed as gaily....\n  \n \n  \"Something troubling you,\nhoney?\"\n  \n \n  His gaze shot back to her and\nshe blurred slightly before his eyes.\n\"No. Nothing at all!\" He summoned\na sickly smile and clutched\nher hand in his. \"Come on. Let's\ndance.\"\n  \n \n  He drew her from the chair and\ninto his arms. She melted toward\nhim as if desiring to become a part\nof him. A tremor of excitement\nsurged through him and threatened\nto turn his knees into quivering\njelly. He could not make his\nfeet conform to the flooding\nrhythm of the music. He half stumbled,\nhalf pushed her along past the\nbooths.\n  \n \n  In the shelter of the palms he\ndrew her savagely to him. \"Let's—let's\ngo outside.\" His voice was little\nmore than a croak.\n  \n \n  \"But, honey!\" She pushed herself\naway, her low voice maddening\nhim. \"Don't you have a private\nroom? A girl doesn't like to be\ntaken outside....\"\n  \n \n  Her words bit into his brain like\nthe blade of a hot knife.\n  \n \n  No, he didn't have a private\nroom at the club like the others. A\nprivate room for his telporter receiver,\na private room where he\ncould take a willing guest. No! He\ncouldn't afford it! No!\n   \n   No!\n   \n  NO!\nHis lot was a cheap suit of satin!\nCheap whiskey! Cheap champagne!\nA cheap shack by the\nriver....\n  \n \n  An inarticulate cry escaped his\ntwisted lips. He clutched her roughly\nto him and dragged her through\nthe door and into the moonlight,\nwhiskey and anger lending him\nbrutal strength.\n  \n \n  He pulled her through the deserted\ngarden.\n   \n   All the others had\nprivate rooms!\n   \n  He pulled her to\nthe far end, behind a clump of\nsquatty firs. His hands clawed at\nher. He tried to smother her mouth\nwith kisses.\n  \n \n  She eluded him deftly. \"But,\n   \n   honey\n   \n  !\" Her voice had gone deeper\ninto her throat. \"I just want to be\nsure about things. If you can't afford\none of the private rooms—if\nyou can't afford to show me a good\ntime—if you can't come here real\noften ...\"\n  \n \n  The whiskey pounded and\nthrobbed at his brain like blows\nfrom an unseen club. His ego\ncurled and twisted within him like\na headless serpent.\n  \n \n  \"I'll have money!\" he shouted,\nstruggling to hold her. \"I'll have\nplenty of money! After tonight!\"\n  \n \n  \"Then we'll wait,\" she said.\n\"We'll wait until tomorrow night.\"\n  \n \n  \"No!\" he screamed. \"You don't\nbelieve me! You're like the others!\nYou think I'm no good! But I'll\nshow you! I'll show all of you!\"\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_7]\nShe had gone\n  coldly rigid in\nhis arms, unyielding.\n  \n \n  Madness added to the pounding\nin his brain.

But the horror\n    \n   is the offer of help that cannot be accepted!\n   \n \n \n \n  \"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high.\nAdrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you.\nIntent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"\n  \n \n  \"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible\nto anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on\nthe walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the\nhabitat hotel and sit tight.\"\n  \n \n  \"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it\nsafe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"\n  \n \n  \"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around\napprehensively. \"Where is he?\"\n  \n \n \n \n  \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise\ndisplay.\"\n  \n \n  A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was\naccustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple\nbobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all\ntravelers were crazy.\n  \n \n  Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk.\nIt would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he\n   \n   could\n   \n  walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?\n  \n \n  A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was\npeculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was\nat a definite disadvantage.\n  \n \n  \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in\nmind.\"\n  \n \n  \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look\nunconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and\nstared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside,\nhe might find safety for a time.\n  \n \n  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude\nhim in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the\nstreets would be brightly lighted—for native eyes. A human would\nconsider it dim.\n  \n \n  \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be\nsomething he hopes to gain.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations.\nAt short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret\nphysiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report\nwhat a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in\nfinding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem\nover to the godawful police.\"\n  \n \n  \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.\n  \n \n  That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give\nthe police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various\nreasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called\nDimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own,\nsay, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the\nproper approach, either.\n  \n \n  \"Weapons?\"\n  \n \n  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long\nknife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"\n  \n \n  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in\nsemantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could\ndie from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of\nprotection himself.\n  \n \n  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on\ntenuous evidence.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's have it anyway.\"\n  \n \n  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For\nsome reason you can't get off this planet.\"\n  \n \n  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand\nstar systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.\n  \n \n  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a\ntransfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he\nhad left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here.\nHe hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't\nunusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as\nreliable as they might be.\n  \n \n  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with\nthat delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was\nself-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_1]\nA grim tale of a future in which everyone is desperate to escape\nreality, and a hero who wants to have his wine and drink it, too.\n   \n \n \n  A BOTTLE OF\n   \n \n   Old Wine\n   \n \n \n  By Richard O.

It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\n  \n \n  Sudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\n  \n \n  Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before—a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself—and complete consciousness—back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\n  \n \n  A waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\n  \n \n  The whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\n  \n \n  They began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\n  \n \n  His arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\n  \n \n  Half way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\n  \n \n  His arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n  \n \n  \"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n  \n \n  \"You know it!\"\n  \n \n  He began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\n  \n \n  Yes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\n  \n \n  He stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\n  \n \n  She drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\n  \n \n  His heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand....\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_3]\nHe let the\n  thought run\naround through his head, savoring\nit with mental taste buds.\nHe would not kill her tonight. No,\nnor the next night. He would wait,\nwait until he had sucked the last\nmeasure of pleasure from the\nthought.\n  \n \n  It was like having a bottle of\nrare old wine on a shelf where it\ncould be viewed daily. It was like\nbeing able to pause again and\nagain before the bottle, hold it up\nto the light, and say to it, \"Some\nday, when my desire for you has\nreached the ultimate, I shall unstopper\nyou quietly and sip you\nslowly to the last soul-satisfying\ndrop.\" As long as the bottle remained\nthere upon the shelf it was\nsymbolic of that pleasurable moment....\n  \n \n  He snapped out of his reverie\nand realized he had been wasting\nprecious moments. There would be\ntime enough tomorrow for gloating.\nTonight, there were other\nthings to do. Pleasurable things.\nHe remembered the girl he had\nmet the night before, and smiled\nsmugly. Perhaps she would be\nawaiting him even now. If not,\nthere would be another one....\n  \n \n  He settled himself deeper into\nthe chair, glanced once more at his\nwife, then let his head lean comfortably\nback against the chair's\nheadrest. His hand upon his thigh\nfelt the thin mesh that cloaked his\nbody beneath his clothing like a\nsheer stocking. His fingers went\nagain to the tiny switch. Again he\nhesitated.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel knew no more\nabout the telporter suit he wore\nthan he did about the radio in the\ncorner, the TV set against the wall,\nor the personalized telovis his wife\nwas wearing. You pressed one of\nthe buttons on the radio; music\ncame out. You pressed a button\nand clicked a dial on the TV;\nmusic and pictures came out. You\npressed a button and made an adjustment\non the telovis; three-dimensional,\nemotion-colored pictures\nleaped into the room. You\npressed a tiny switch on the telporter\nsuit; you were whisked away to\na receiving set you had previously\nset up in secret.\n  \n \n  He knew that the music and the\nimages of the performers on the\nTV and telovis were brought to his\nroom by some form of electrical impulse\nor wave while the actual musicians\nand performers remained in\nthe studio. He knew that when he\npressed the switch on his thigh\nsomething within him—his ectoplasm,\nhigher self, the thing spirits\nuse for materialization, whatever\nits real name—streamed out of him\nalong an invisible channel, leaving\nhis body behind in the chair in a\nconscious but dream-like state. His\nother self materialized in a small\ncabin in a hidden nook between a\nhighway and a river where he had\ninstalled the receiving set a month\nago.\n  \n \n  He thought once more of the girl\nwho might be waiting for him,\nsmiled, and pressed the switch.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.\n\n**Step 1: The teleporter suit is established as Herbert Hyrel's primary means of escape.**\nThe story introduces the teleporter suit as Hyrel's personal method for escaping his miserable home life and his wife, whom he despises. While his wife uses a \"personalized, three-dimensional telovis\" to escape, Hyrel has a more tangible method. The suit represents freedom and a secret life, accessible with a simple action.\n\n##begin_quote##\nBut it was comforting to know that it was there, exhilarating to know that he could escape for a few hours by a mere flick of his finger.\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 2: The suit's limitations and associated costs fuel Hyrel's dark motivations.**\nHyrel's escape is incomplete because he cannot afford the lifestyle he desires at the Riverside Club, a sanctuary for other suit owners. The suit itself is a financial burden, and his inability to afford luxuries like private rooms or expensive champagne intensifies his feelings of inadequacy and resentment. This financial pressure directly connects his desire for escape to his murderous plan to get his wife's money.\n\n##begin_quote##\nHe had skimped for six months to salvage enough money from his allowance to make a down payment on the telporter suit. Since then, his expenses—monthly payments for the suit, cabin rent, costly liquor—had forced him to place his nights of escape on strict ration.\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 3: The suit becomes a critical tool in Hyrel's murder plot\n\n##Answer: "}], "metadata": {"id": "273", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 2, "reference_answers": ["Teleporter suits play an important role in the relationship of Herbert and his wife, but also in the society that they live in more broadly. In terms of broad significance, the teleporter suits are important to the Riverside Club, as only people who own one are allowed to enter. They are illegal to own, so the club had to be careful about who they let in. Even though they are frowned upon, it seems they are a popular purchase for those who can afford them. Both Herbert and his wife own one, though we don't learn that his wife has one until the end of the story. For Herbert, the teleporter suit is his ticket to spend time outside of the house that he feels trapped in, in a relationship that he is not happy in. It allows him to visit this club and meet other people. At the same time, it is these suits that allowed his wife to follow him to the club and convince him to admit his plans, eventually ending in his death. After she shoots him, she hides her own suit but leaves his on his person. Because the body in the suit and the other copy of the body experience things differently, it was a sneaky way to kill her husband. ", "Teleporter suits are an illegal yet highly sought-after and expensive tech gadget in this society. With this suit, the wearer can be transported to another realm, while their body remains in place. Their souls can have fun, dance the night away, drink as much as they want, and their partners or families will never know. The next morning, however, when they return to their corporeal body, they will carry last night’s hangover with them to the physical realm. \nThe teleporter suit allows Herbert Hyrel to escape his suffocating household and relish in his manly and sexual fantasies. He wants to prove himself to society and to brand himself as something he is not. In this other world, he can pretend to be a much richer, more powerful man. His rich wife makes him feel insignificant, so he takes his troubles to the shadow realm. \nThe teleporter suits allow the wearer to travel between realms, but a connection between the shadow self and body remains. Whatever happens to the shadow self, will also happen to the corporeal self, only the physical or visual element will not be there. So, if someone were to get hurt in the shadow realm, their physical body would feel the pain but would not bear the scars. \nThis allows Mrs. Herbert Hyrel to murder her husband in the shadow realm, and return to the physical world without blood or any incriminating evidence. \n", "The telporter suits catalyze the major conflict in the story. In one sense, Herbert's telporter suit represents his ability to escape what he considers to be an emasculating, oppressive marriage. On the other hand, Mrs. Hyrel's secret telporter suit leads to Herbert's eventual demise. The suits are made of a thin mesh that fits the body like a stocking and can be worn underneath one's clothes. The telporter can be engaged by flicking a small switch, and it sends its wearer to a receiver at a previously-set location. Herbert installs his receiver at a small cabin in the woods a short distance away from the Riverside Club since he cannot afford the private rooms there. Herbert does not understand the mechanics behind the suit, but he grasps its basic function--the suits transport a person's \"shadowy self\" from one's body and the body is left in \"a conscious but dream-like state.\" When the shadowy self returns, the body does not retain any scars the shadowy self may have sustained but it does feel the pain of those injuries. Self-telportation is also illegal, although the Riverside Club maintains police protection by charging high prices and paying them off. Mrs. Hyrel uses to her advantage when she foils Herbert's plans to kill her and instead kills him and makes it appear as if he simply died while engaging in illegal activity.", "\n\tThe teleporter suits provide people with a means of escape from their boring or unpleasant lives. Many people have them and use them to go to the Riverside Club where they can abandon their lives and live for the pleasure of the moment without anyone knowing who they are since everyone there wears costumes and masks. In addition, self-teleportation is illegal, so no one wants anyone else to know they have teleportation suits. When people use their teleporter suits, their real bodies stay where they are in reality while their “shadow” bodies travel to another place. People who teleport to the Riverside Club can do anything they want without their spouses or anyone else knowing what they are doing. Meanwhile, since their real bodies remain in “real life,” it looks as if the person is still there, doing nothing out of the ordinary that can draw suspicion or blame from anyone who knows them. \n"]}}

By the wavering light, he finished\ndressing in the black satin\nclothing, the white shirt, the flowing\nnecktie and tam. He invoiced\nthe contents of his billfold. Not\nmuch. And his monthly pittance\nwas still two weeks away....\n  \n \n  He had skimped for six months\nto salvage enough money from his\nallowance to make a down payment\non the telporter suit. Since\nthen, his expenses—monthly payments\nfor the suit, cabin rent, costly\nliquor—had forced him to place his\nnights of escape on strict ration. He\ncould not go on this way, he realized.\nNot now. Not since he had\nmet the girl. He had to have more\nmoney. Perhaps he could not afford\nthe luxury of leaving the wine\nbottle longer upon the shelf....\n  \n \n  Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived\nby bus and a hundred yards\nof walking, was exclusive. It catered\nto a clientele that had but\nthree things in common: money, a\ndesire for utter self-abandonment,\nand a sales slip indicating ownership\nof a telporter suit. The club\nwas of necessity expensive, for self-telportation\nwas strictly illegal, and\npolice protection came high.\n  \n \n  Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white,\nsilken mask carefully at the door\nand shoved his sales slip through a\nsmall aperture where it was thoroughly\nscanned by unseen eyes. A\nbuzzer sounded an instant later, the\nlock on the door clicked, and Hyrel\npushed through into the exhilarating\nwarmth of music and laughter.\n  \n \n  The main room was large. Hidden\nlights along the walls sent slow\nbeams of red, blue, vermillion,\ngreen, yellow and pink trailing\nacross the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous\npattern. The colored\nbeams mingled, diffused, spread,\nwere caught up by mirrors of various\ntints which diffused and mingled\nthe lights once more until the\nwhole effect was an ever-changing\npanorama of softly-melting shades.\n  \n \n  The gay and bizarre costumes of\nthe masked revelers on the dance\nfloor and at the tables, unearthly in\nthemselves, were made even more\nso by the altering light. Music\nflooded the room from unseen\nsources. Laughter—hysterical,\ndrunken, filled with utter abandonment—came\nfrom the dance floor,\nthe tables, and the private booths\nand rooms hidden cleverly within\nthe walls.\n  \n \n  Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied\ntable, sat down and ordered\na bottle of cheap whiskey. He\nwould have preferred champagne,\nbut his depleted finances forbade\nthe more discriminate taste.\n  \n \n  When his order arrived, he\npoured a glass tumbler half full\nand consumed it eagerly while his\neyes scanned the room in search of\nthe girl. He couldn't see her in the\ndim swirl of color. Had she arrived?\nPerhaps she was wearing a\ndifferent costume than she had the\nnight before. If so, recognition\nmight prove difficult.\n  \n \n  He poured himself another drink,\npromising himself he would go in\nsearch of her when the liquor began\nto take effect.\n  \n \n  A woman clad in the revealing\ngarb of a Persian dancer threw an\narm about him from behind and\nkissed him on the cheek through\nthe veil which covered the lower\npart of her face.\n  \n \n  \"Hi, honey,\" she giggled into his\near. \"Havin' a time?\"\n  \n \n  He reached for the white arm to\npull her to him, but she eluded his\ngrasp and reeled away into the\nwaiting arms of a tall toreador.\nHyrel gulped his whiskey and\nwatched her nestle into the arms of\nher partner and begin with him a\nsinuous, suggestive dance. The\nwhiskey had begun its warming effect,\nand he laughed.\n  \n \n  This was the land of the lotus\neaters, the sanctuary of the escapists,\nthe haven of all who wished to\ncast off their shell of inhibition and\nbecome the thing they dreamed\nthemselves to be. Here one could\nbe among his own kind, an actor\nupon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly\nmetamorphosed from the slug,\na knight of old.\n  \n \n  The Persian dancing girl was\nprobably the wife of a boorish oaf\nwhose idea of romance was spending\nan evening telling his wife how\nhe came to be a successful bank\npresident. But she had found her\nmeans of escape. Perhaps she had\npleaded a sick headache and had\nretired to her room. And there upon\nthe bed now reposed her shell of\nreality while her inner self, the\nshadowy one, completely materialized,\nbecame an exotic thing from\nthe East in this never-never land.\n  \n \n  The man, the toreador, had\nprobably closeted himself within his\nlibrary with a set of account books\nand had left strict orders not to be\ndisturbed until he had finished\nwith them.\n  \n \n  Both would have terrific hangovers\nin the morning. But that, of\ncourse, would be fully compensated\nfor by the memories of the evening.\n  \n \n  Hyrel chuckled. The situation\nstruck him as being funny: the\nshadowy self got drunk and had a\ngood time, and the outer husk suffered\nthe hangover in the morning.\nStrange. Strange how a device such\nas the telporter suit could cause the\nshadow of each bodily cell to leave\nthe body, materialize, and become\na reality in its own right. And\nyet ...\n\n[Chapter: A_BOTTLE_OF_Old_Wine_5]\nHe looked\n  at the heel of his\nleft hand. There was a long,\nirregular scar there. It was the result\nof a cut he had received nearly\nthree weeks ago when he had\nfallen over this very table and had\nrammed his hand into a sliver of\nbroken champagne glass. Later that\nevening, upon re-telporting back\nhome, the pain of the cut had remained\nin his hand, but there was\nno sign of the cut itself on the hand\nof his outer self. The scar was peculiar\nto the shadowy body only.\nThere was something about the\nshadowy body that carried the\nhurts to the outer body, but not the\nscars....\n  \n \n  Sudden laughter broke out near\nhim, and he turned quickly in that\ndirection. A group of gaily costumed\nrevelers was standing in a\nsemi-circle about a small mound of\nclothing upon the floor. It was the\ncostume of the toreador.\n  \n \n  Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened\nmany times before—a costume\nsuddenly left empty as its\nowner, due to a threat of discovery\nat home, had had to press the\nswitch in haste to bring his shadowy\nself—and complete consciousness—back\nto his outer self in a\nhurry.\n  \n \n  A waiter picked up the clothing.\nHe would put it safely away so that\nthe owner could claim it upon his\nnext visit to the club. Another\nwaiter placed a fresh bottle of\nwhiskey on the table before Hyrel,\nand Hyrel paid him for it.\n  \n \n  The whiskey, reaching his head\nnow in surges of warm cheerfulness,\nwas filling him with abandonment,\ncourage, and a desire for\nmerriment. He pushed himself up\nfrom the table, joined the merry\nthrong, threw his arm about the\nPersian dancer, drew her close.\n  \n \n  They began dancing slowly to\nthe throbbing rhythm, dancing and\nholding on to each other tightly.\nHyrel could feel her hot breath\nthrough her veil upon his neck, adding\nto the headiness of the liquor.\nHis feeling of depression and inferiority\nflowed suddenly from him.\nOnce again he was the all-conquering\nmale.\n  \n \n  His arm trembled as it drew her\nstill closer to him and he began\ndancing directly and purposefully\ntoward the shadows of a clump of\nartificial palms near one corner of\nthe room. There was an exit to the\ngarden behind the palms.\n  \n \n  Half way there they passed a secluded\nbooth from which protruded\na long leg clad in black\nmesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he\nrecognized that part of the costume.\nIt was she! The girl! The\none he had met so briefly the night\nbefore!\n  \n \n  His arm slid away from the Persian\ndancer, took hold of the mesh-clad\nleg, and pulled. A female form\nfollowed the leg from the booth\nand fell into his arms. He held her\ntightly, kissed her white neck, let\nher perfume send his thoughts reeling.\n  \n \n  \"Been looking for me, honey?\"\nshe whispered, her voice deep and\nthroaty.\n  \n \n  \"You know it!\"\n  \n \n  He began whisking her away toward\nthe palms. The Persian girl\nwas pulled into the booth.\n  \n \n  Yes, she was wearing the same\ncostume she had worn the night\nbefore, that of a can-can dancer of\nthe 90's. The mesh hose that encased\nher shapely legs were held up\nby flowered supporters in such a\nmanner as to leave four inches of\nwhite leg exposed between hose top\nand lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled\nto suggest innumerable petticoats,\nfell away at each hip, leaving the\nfront open to expose the full length\nof legs. She wore a wig of platinum\nhair encrusted with jewels that\nsparkled in the lights. Her jewel-studded\nmask was as white as her\nhair and covered the upper half of\nher face, except for the large\nalmond slits for her eyes. A white\npurse, jewel crusted, dangled from\none arm.\n  \n \n  He stopped once before reaching\nthe palms, drew her closer, kissed\nher long and ardently. Then he began\npulling her on again.\n  \n \n  She drew back when they\nreached the shelter of the fronds.\n\"Champagne, first,\" she whispered\nhuskily into his ear.\n  \n \n  His heart sank. He had very little\nmoney left. Well, it might buy\na cheap brand....\n\n[Chapter: The_Snare_11]\nSix rooms were open to our use.

A\nmurderer has to outwit an entire civilization. We have to outwit an\nentire civilization that was hundreds of times more advanced than ours\nis now when we were clubbing animals and eating the meat raw.

However, this escape is not available to everyone. It is an exclusive, illegal establishment catering only to the wealthy elite who can afford the high costs of both membership and the required technology. The club's clientele shares a specific set of characteristics that define its purpose within this society. They are united by their wealth, their ownership of an illegal telporter suit, and a profound need to break free from their real lives.\n\n##begin_quote##\nRiverside Club, where Hyrel arrived by bus and a hundred yards of walking, was exclusive.

The masked, costumed environment allows them to transform into the people they fantasize about being, free from the constraints of their everyday existence. It is a place where a \"successful bank president\" can become a toreador and his wife can become a Persian dancer. The club is explicitly described as a sanctuary for those who want to live out their dreams, providing a temporary but potent antidote to their grim or boring realities.\n\n##begin_quote##\nThis was the land of the lotus eaters, the sanctuary of the escapists, the haven of all who wished to cast off their shell of inhibition and become the thing they dreamed themselves to be.\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 3: The Club's Role as a Narrative Catalyst**\nThe Riverside Club is crucial to the narrative because it is not only the setting for the climax but also the catalyst for Herbert Hyrel's downfall. While the club offers escape, Hyrel's lack of funds prevents him from fully participating. He can only afford cheap whiskey and cannot rent a private room, which highlights his feelings of inadequacy and fuels his resentment. This frustration, amplified by alcohol and the girl's rejection, pushes him over the edge, causing him to drunkenly confess his plan to murder his wife.

Everyone who goes there is looking to escape themselves, but ironically Herbert escapes his wife to end up right back in front of her. Besides being a point of interest because it offered the clearest path of escape for Herbert, the club is also important because it shows glimpses into how the suits work: when someone has to leave suddenly, their clothes are left behind because it is just the copy of the body that moves. The club also was significant to the story because it provided a place for Herbert's wife to play out her plan to catch Herbert in his own plot.", "The Riverside Club represents the most hedonistic, wealthy, and illusion-filled group of people. It caters to the wealthy, giving them a place to escape the troubles and rules of the corporeal world and loosen up with ample drinks and scantily-clad people. The Riverside Club creates a fantasy for people to run away to, a dreamworld where cheating isn’t bad, where over-drinking is normal, and where people can be whoever they want to be. \nIn the case of Mr. Herbert Hyrel, he travels to the Riverside Club to make himself feel like more of the man he wants to be. He goes there to pick up women, prove to them that he’s worth something, as well as prove that same sentiment to himself. His rich wife no longer shares her money nor her time with him, which only further emasculates him. He travels to the Riverside Club in search of fantasy and other women. However, he had to use her money in order to buy the teleporter suit that could take him there. The Riverside Club eventually becomes the scene of Hyrel’s reunion with his wife and subsequent murder. \n", "The Riverside Club is a social club where revelers can self-telport in order to escape their outer lives and dress in lavish costumes, drink champagne, and dance and sleep together in private rooms. The club has a large main room softly lit by intermingling, colored lights. People dance on the dance floor in this room and dine and drink together at tables surrounding it. There are also private rooms and booths hidden within the walls surrounding the main room. Near the exit stands a clump of artificial palm trees which leads outside to a garden where Herbert attempts to drag the mysterious woman when they are dancing together, presumably for a sexual encounter. Herbert wants to go outside because he cannot afford a private room, and when the mysterious woman insists they wait until he can afford one, Herbert explodes in a rage and reveals his plot to kill his wife. The club is quite expensive for practical purposes--since self-telportation is illegal, they need to charge enough to cover the cost of paying off the police. The Riverside Club represents Herbert's physical and mental retreat from his miserable life and is also the environment that ultimately leads to his death.", "The Riverside Club is an exclusive club for people with money who want to live out their fantasies without other people knowing who they are or what they are doing. The club requires its members to have money, a desire for self-abandonment, and a teleporter suit; it encourages people to act without society’s limitations on its citizens. It offers alcoholic beverages, private booths and rooms, and places outdoors where couples can engage in any activity they want. The club’s atmosphere is happy, fun, and exotic with altering lights, music, drinks, and dancing. It offers people the opportunity to remain physically present in their acceptable roles while escaping those roles in private. Because their real identities are hidden, people can act in ways that are uncharacteristic to them, with unpopular people becoming popular, depressed people becoming cheerful, and inferior-feeling men becoming “all-conquering males.” \n\tIn the story, the Riverside Club is significant because it is the escape that Herbert and his wife both turn to, enabling them to act out their fantasies away from each other. However, it is ironic that the girl Herbert meets and can’t wait to see again is his wife. She, however, knows who Herbert is since she is prepared and has a gun and kills him when he says he is going to murder his wife. Mrs. Hryel seems to have been going to the club to ultimately get rid of Herbert and enjoy herself since she is in a private booth with someone else when he finds her. It also seems that she has had “entertainment” with other men because she tells him, “A girl doesn’t like to be taken outside,” and Herbert interprets this as meaning she has had assignations with other men, but those men all had private rooms. \n"]}}

A lock of hair\nhad fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat\nJoggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the\ngrim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era.\n  \n \n  \"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  \"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the\nskulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the\nNavies.\"\n  \n \n  Hal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even\nif it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\"\n  \n \n  \"They won't let me in, either.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully.\n  \n \n  \"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the\ndifference.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their\nfeet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened\nhis mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in\ntight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier—like Stalin, maybe, he\nthought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which\ndrank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher\nlimped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his\nbattle injury.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_2]\nThe gray dog hurled itself on Darter. Jaws gaped to get a hold on necks\nso short and thick as to be mere courtesy terms. They whirled like a\nfanged merry-go-round. Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and\none pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard.\n  \n \n  Butch yawned.\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" inquired Darter's master. \"I thought you liked dog\nfights, Butch.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do like dog fights,\" Butch said somberly, without looking around. \"I\ndon't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else.\nNobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy—and you, too, Hal—when you\ntalk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's not exactly a functional name,\" Hal observed with the\njudiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: \"All\nright, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people\nwere hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly would,\" the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back\nskeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed\nup his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He\nsqueaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.\n  \n \n  \"A kid can't do anything any more,\" he announced dramatically. \"Can't\nbreak anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose.\nCan't get dirty except in the dirt-pen—and they graduate him from that\nwhen he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj—it's contraprogrammed.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?\" Hal asked in a gentle voice\nacquired from a robot adolescer.\n  \n \n  \"I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,\" the\nButcher replied airily. \"A swell book. That guy got dirtier than\nanything.\" His eyes became dreamy. \"He even ate out of a garbage pail.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a garbage pail?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, but it sounds great.\"\n  \n \n  The battling uninjes careened into them. Brute had Darter by the ear\nand was whirling him around hilariously.\n  \n \n  \"Aw,\n   \n   quit\n   \n  it, Brute,\" the Butcher said in annoyance.\n  \n \n  Brute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no\nattention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight.\n  \n \n  The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. \"You're making too much\nof a rumpus,\" he said. \"I want to think.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_4]\nThe others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Butch scowled.\n  \n \n  \"How about it, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Still Butch did not seem to hear.\n  \n \n  The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it—Butcher?\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You\nsaid so yourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could walk us over there.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\"\n  \n \n  \"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n  \n \n  He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n  \n \n  With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n  \n \n  Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n  \n \n  \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n  \n \n  Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n  \n \n  Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_1]\nTIME IN THE ROUND\n  \n \n  By FRITZ LEIBER\n  \n \n  Illustrated by DILLON\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction May 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Poor Butcher suffered more than any dictator\n    \n   in history: everybody gave in to him because\n    \n   he was so puny and they were so impregnable!\n   \n \n \n \n  From the other end of the Avenue of Wisdom that led across the Peace\nPark, a gray, hairless, heavily built dog was barking soundlessly at\nthe towering crystal glory of the Time Theater. For a moment, the\neffect was almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of\ncivilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy caught up\nwith the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the\nscene was normal again.\n  \n \n  The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied\nthe dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and\npoked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his\ngrip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony\npavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip\nand suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff\ntube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an\nupside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long\nblack tongue lolled.\n  \n \n  The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube\nwith a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone\ncalled: \"Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em!\"\n  \n \n  A larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the\nluxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that,\nexcept for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog.\n  \n \n  Butch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice:\n\"Kill 'em, Brute.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_6]\nHal looked back. \"Honestly, the usher will stop you.\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher shook his head. \"I'm going to think my way in. I'm going to\nthink old.\"\n  \n \n  \"You won't be able to fool the usher, Butcher. You under-fives\nsimply aren't allowed in the Time Theater. There's a good reason for\nit—something dangerous might happen if an under-five got inside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't exactly know, but something.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hah! I bet they're scared we'd go traveling in the Time Bubble and\nhave some excitement.\"\n  \n \n  \"They are not. I guess they just know you'd get bored and wander away\nfrom your seats and maybe disturb the adults or upset the electronics\nor something. But don't worry about it, Butcher. The usher will take\ncare of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up—I'm thinking I'm World Director,\" the Butcher informed them,\ncontorting his face diabolically.\n  \n \n  Hal spoke to the uninjes, pointing to the side of the corridor.\nObediently four of them lined up.\n  \n \n  But Brute was peering down the corridor toward where it merged into a\ndeeper darkness. His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to\nretreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed\nback to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound\nissued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other\nuninjes moved uneasily.\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy\nwhispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still\nfixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.\n  \n \n  The three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely\nelectrical tingling that vanished almost immediately. They looked back.\nThe Butcher had been stopped by an invisible wall.\n  \n \n  \"I told you you couldn't fool the usher,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  The Butcher hurled himself forward. The wall gave a little, then\nbounced him back with equal force.\n  \n \n  \"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving\nup, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell\nhow old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you\nthrough a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the\nusher.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_9]\nAs if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on\ntheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For\nan instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing\nsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the\nbubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the\nback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on\nthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some\ntime.\n  \n \n  He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.\n  \n \n  \"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice\ncut in.\n  \n \n  Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the\ncubicle. One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand while\nmopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other.\n  \n \n  Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: \"Butch!\"\n  \n \n  But Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble.\n  \n \n  \"Then how is it, Hal,\" he asked, \"that light comes out of the bubble,\nif the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks toward\nus, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the light\ncoming our way disappear, too?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well—you see, Joggy, it isn't real light. It's—\"\n  \n \n  Once more the interpreter helped him out.\n  \n \n  \"The light that comes from the bubble is an isotope. Like atoms of\none element, photons of a single frequency also have isotopes. It's\nmore than a matter of polarization. One of these isotopes of light\ntends to leak futureward through holes in space-time. Most of the\nlight goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience.\nBut one isotope is diverted through the walls of the bubble into the\nTime Theater. Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater,\nyou haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is. That's because we're\ngetting only a single isotope of the original light. Incidentally, no\nisotopes have been discovered that leak pastward, though attempts are\nbeing made to synthesize them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, explanations!\" murmured one of the newly arrived girls. \"The cubs\nare always angling for them. Apple-polishers!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  like this show,\" a familiar voice announced serenely. \"They cut\nanybody yet with those choppers?\"\n  \n \n  Hal looked down beside him. \"Butch! How did you manage to get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't see any blood. Where's the bodies?\"\n  \n \n  \"But how\n   \n   did\n   \n  you get in—Butcher?\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_8]\nSometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway—for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped—and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why—er—you see, Joggy—\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_13]\nGrowling quite unmechanically, the five uninjes hurled themselves\nforward and closed with the warrior's wolflike dogs. At the first\nencounter, Brute and Pinkie were grabbed by the throats, shaken, and\ntossed a dozen feet. The warriors snarled approval and advanced. But\nthen Brute and Pinkie raced back eagerly to the fight—and suddenly the\nface of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and\ntouched his fingers to it, then looked at his hand in horror.\n  \n \n  The Butcher spared a second to repeat his command to the uninjes. But\nalready the battle was going against the larger dogs. The latter had\nthe advantage of weight and could toss the smaller dogs like so many\nfoxes. But their terrible fangs did no damage, and whenever an uninj\nclamped on a throat, that throat was torn out.\n  \n \n  Meanwhile, great bloody stains had appeared on the bodies of all the\nwarriors. They drew back in a knot, looking at each other fearfully.\nThat was when the Butcher got to his feet and strode forward, hand\nclenching the levitator above his head.\n  \n \n  \"Get back where you belong, you big jerks! And drop that lady!\"\n  \n \n  The first warrior pointed toward him and hissed something. Immediately,\na half dozen swords were smiting at the Butcher.\n  \n \n  \"We are working to energize the safeguards,\" the interpreter said in\nmechanical panic. \"Remain patient and in your seats.\"\n  \n \n  The uninjes leaped into the melee, at first tearing more fur than\nflesh. Swords caught them and sent them spinning through the air. They\ncame yapping back for more. Brute fixed on the first warrior's ankle.\nHe dropped the woman, stamped unavailingly on the uninj, and let out a\nscreech.\n  \n \n  Swords were still rebounding from the invisible shield under which the\nButcher crouched, making terrible faces at his attackers. They drew\nback, looked again at their bloodstains, goggled at the demon dogs.\nAt their leader's screech, they broke and plunged back into the Time\nBubble, their leader stumbling limpingly after them. There they wasted\nno time on their own ragged sorcerer. Their swords rose and fell, and\nno repulsor field stayed them.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, come back!\" the Butcher yelled.\n\n[Chapter: MASTER_of_Life_and_Death_1]\nmen slinked away, he added, \"And figure out some more efficient system for protecting me. Some day an assassin is going to sneak through here and get me. Not that I give a damn about myself, you understand; it's simply that I'm indispensable. There isn't another lunatic in the world who'd take this job. Now get out !\" They wasted no time in leaving. Walton waited until the door closed and jammed down hard on the lockstud. His tirade, he knew, was wholly unjustified; if he had remembered to lock his door as regulations prescribed, Prior would never have broken in. But he couldn't admit that to the guards. \"Take a seat, Mr. Prior.\" \"I have to thank you for granting me this audience,\" Prior said, without a hint of sarcasm in his booming voice. \"I realize you're a terribly busy man.\" \"I am.\" Another three inches of paper had deposited itself on Walton's desk since Prior had entered. \"You're very lucky to have hit the psychological moment for your entrance. At any other time I'd have had you brigged for a month, but just now I'm in need of a little diversion. Besides, I very much admire your work, Mr. Prior.\" \"Thank you.\" Again that humility, startling in so big and commanding a man. \"I hadn't expected to find—I mean that you—\" \"That a bureaucrat should admire poetry? Is that what you're groping for?\" Prior reddened. \"Yes,\" he admitted. Grinning, Walton said, \"I have to do something when I go home at night. I don't really read Popeek reports twenty-four hours a day. No more than twenty; that's my rule. I thought your last book was quite remarkable.\" \"The critics didn't,\" Prior said diffidently. \"Critics! What do they know?\" Walton demanded. \"They swing in cycles. Ten years ago it was form and technique, and you got the Melling Prize. Now it's message, political content that counts. That's not poetry, Mr. Prior—and there are still a few of us who recognize what poetry is. Take Yeats, for instance—\" Walton was ready to launch into a discussion of every poet from Prior back to Surrey and Wyatt; anything to keep from the job at hand, anything to keep his mind from Popeek. But Prior interrupted him. \"Mr. Walton....\" \"Yes?\" \"My son Philip ... he's two weeks old now....\" Walton understood. \"No, Prior. Please don't ask.\" Walton's skin felt cold; his hands, tightly clenched, were clammy. \"He was committed to Happysleep this morning—potentially tubercular. The boy's perfectly sound, Mr. Walton. Couldn't you—\" Walton rose. \" No ,\" he said, half-commanding, half-pleading. \"Don't ask me to do it. I can't make any exceptions, not even for you. You're an intelligent man; you understand our program.\" \"I voted for Popeek. I know all about Weeding the Garden and the Euthanasia Plan. But I hadn't expected—\" \"You thought euthanasia was a fine thing for other people. So did everyone else,\" Walton said. \"That's how the act was passed.\" Tenderly he said, \"I can't do it. I can't spare your son. Our doctors give a baby every chance to live.\" \" I was tubercular. They cured me. What if they had practiced euthanasia a generation ago? Where would my poems be now?\" It was an unanswerable question; Walton tried to ignore it. \"Tuberculosis is an extremely rare disease, Mr. Prior. We can wipe it out completely if we strike at those with TB-susceptible genetic traits.\" \"Meaning you'll kill any children I have?\" Prior asked. \"Those who inherit your condition,\" Walton said gently. \"Go home, Mr. Prior. Burn me in effigy. Write a poem about me. But don't ask me to do the impossible. I can't catch any falling stars for you.\" Prior rose. He was immense, a hulking tragic figure staring broodingly at Walton. For the first time since the poet's abrupt entry, Walton feared violence. His fingers groped for the needle gun he kept in his upper left desk drawer. But Prior had no violence in him. \"I'll leave you,\" he said somberly. \"I'm sorry, sir. Deeply sorry. For both of us.\" Walton pressed the doorlock to let him out, then locked it again and slipped heavily into his chair. Three more reports slid out of the chute and landed on his desk. He stared at them as if they were three basilisks. In the six weeks of Popeek's existence, three thousand babies had been ticketed for Happysleep, and three thousand sets of degenerate genes had been wiped from the race. Ten thousand subnormal males had been sterilized. Eight thousand dying oldsters had reached their graves ahead of time. It was a tough-minded program. But why transmit palsy to unborn generations? Why let an adult idiot litter the world with subnormal progeny? Why force a man hopelessly cancerous to linger on in pain, consuming precious food? Unpleasant? Sure. But the world had voted for it. Until Lang and his team succeeded in terraforming Venus, or until the faster-than-light outfit opened the stars to mankind, something had to be done about Earth's overpopulation. There were seven billion now and the figure was still growing. Prior's words haunted him. I was tubercular ... where would my poems be now? The big humble man was one of the great poets. Keats had been tubercular too. What good are poets? he asked himself savagely. The reply came swiftly: What good is anything, then? Keats, Shakespeare, Eliot, Yeats, Donne, Pound, Matthews ... and Prior. How much duller life would be without them, Walton thought, picturing his bookshelf—his one bookshelf, in his crowded little cubicle of a one-room home. Sweat poured down his back as he groped toward his decision. The step he was considering would disqualify him from his job if he admitted it, though he wouldn't do that. Under the Equalization Law, it would be a criminal act. But just one baby wouldn't matter. Just one. Prior's baby. With nervous fingers he switched on the annunciator and said, \"If there are any calls for me, take the message. I'll be out of my office for the next half-hour.\" II He stepped out of the office, glancing around furtively. The outer office was busy: half a dozen girls were answering calls, opening letters, coordinating activities. Walton slipped quickly past them into the hallway. There was a knot of fear in his stomach as he turned toward the lift tube. Six weeks of pressure, six weeks of tension since Popeek was organized and old man FitzMaugham had tapped him for the second-in-command post ... and now, a rebellion. The sparing of a single child was a small rebellion, true, but he knew he was striking as effectively at the base of Popeek this way as if he had brought about repeal of the entire Equalization Law. Well, just one lapse, he promised himself. I'll spare Prior's child, and after that I'll keep within the law. He jabbed the lift tube indicator and the tube rose in its shaft. The clinic was on the twentieth floor. \"Roy.\" At the sound of the quiet voice behind him, Walton jumped in surprise. He steadied himself, forcing himself to turn slowly. The director stood there. \"Good morning, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" The old man was smiling serenely, his unlined face warm and friendly, his mop of white hair bright and full. \"You look preoccupied, boy. Something the matter?\" Walton shook his head quickly. \"Just a little tired, sir. There's been a lot of work lately.\" As he said it, he knew how foolish it sounded. If anyone in Popeek worked harder than he did, it was the elderly director. FitzMaugham had striven for equalization legislature for fifty years, and now, at the age of eighty, he put in a sixteen-hour day at the task of saving mankind from itself. The director smiled. \"You never did learn how to budget your strength, Roy. You'll be a worn-out wreck before you're half my age. I'm glad you're adopting my habit of taking a coffee break in the morning, though. Mind if I join you?\" \"I'm—not taking a break, sir. I have some work to do downstairs.\" \"Oh? Can't you take care of it by phone?\" \"No, Mr. FitzMaugham.\" Walton felt as though he'd already been tried, drawn, and quartered. \"It requires personal attention.\" \"I see.\" The deep, warm eyes bored into his. \"You ought to slow down a little, I think.\" \"Yes, sir. As soon as the work eases up a little.\" FitzMaugham chuckled. \"In another century or two, you mean. I'm afraid you'll never learn how to relax, my boy.\" The lift tube arrived. Walton stepped to one side, allowed the Director to enter, and got in himself. FitzMaugham pushed Fourteen ; there was a coffee shop down there. Hesitantly, Walton pushed twenty , covering the panel with his arm so the old man would be unable to see his destination.

The boy is trying to do something to the dog with a small metal tube when Hal, another boy, shows up with his own dogs, and another boy named Joggy. It turns out these are not normal dogs, but are \"uninj\", machines created to be like dogs but not able to be hurt. Butch seems bored with these countermeasures against violence, and intent on putting violence back in the world. His interactions with Hal show us that they live in a civilization where the children are given opportunities to work out any violent and angry tendencies or impulses before they are conditioned as adults. They are only allowed to visit the Time Theater to see glimpses into other societies (and thus evidence of violence) after age five, and the change in mentality happens at age six. Butch wants to use Time Bubble to travel through time, but Hal insists that this is impossible. The boys head to this theater, an incredible crystal building with an important place in this society, choosing to fly there with their hover technology. Joggy is five, so he is allowed to enter with Hal, but Butch is blocked from entering by the ushers, which Hal says is for his own protection. Joggy and Hal take a seat in a children's viewing area to look into the glowing orb of light that sits in the middle of the round theater. The orb acts as a viewport into various times and places, and is currently showing a view of Earth, Scandanavia more specifically, around year zero according to Earth calendars. There are a number of warriors in the forest scene, along with some dogs and a sorcerer, and the boys watch in earnest. As the electronic interpreter for the viewing gives the boys more information about cultural context, Butch manages to sneak in to the theater by lying to the ushers. Shortly after Butch and two young girls join the viewing, something happened that no-one thought possible: the sorcerer pushed one of the warriors through the orb of the Time Bubble, throwing him into the theater. Panic falls on the audience, and warriors and dogs continue to enter the theater as Butch and the uninjes start to fight off the time-travelers with their design keeping them from being injured. Hal is convinced that this happened because an under-five (Butch specifically) was in the theater, but the rest of the public does not know he is young and they thank him for saving the day as he fights off the warriors and the Time Bubble collapses. This is the first piece of chaos the adults have experienced in their adult lives, and the Butcher is content with how it all played out, getting to play hero in a violent setting for a day with Brute.", "Brute, a dog made of hyperplastic, barks without making a noise. He is an uninje. He is programmed to be very similar to a real dog, but he is incapable of being injured. His owner, a boy named Butch, tackles him and pokes him in the eye and hits him. Butch then orders all of the dogs to fight, but becomes bored moments later. He tells his friends, Joggy and Hal that he wishes he lived like Huckleberry Finn, with the ability to get dirty and inflict pain.\n\nButch says that one day he will be the World Director, and he will bring back war. Hal, who is older and more mature, explains that Butch’s desire for violence will be conditioned out of him once he turns six. He says that Butch will understand everything once he’s allowed in the Time Theater to see into the past. \n\nHal and Joggy decide to go to the Time Theater. Butch climbs on Joggy’s back, and they use Joggy’s harness and the repulsor hemisphere to propel them forward. When the boys arrive, they warn Butch that he will be stopped by the usher. Hal explains that something dangerous might happen if a young child is allowed in. The uninjes line up obediently next to Butch. \n\nButch tries to get past the invisible wall keeping him out of the theater, but he can’t. Meanwhile, Hal and Joggy enter a dilated sphincter and sit down in a transparent cubicle. They take their levitators off to enjoy the show in the dark auditorium. In the center of the room is the Time Bubble, which transmits images of the past. They watch Scandinavian warriors holding long swords, surrounded by dogs, listening to a hooded figure chant.\nJoggy has several questions about the show, and the interpreter in the room answers them. He wonders why light can’t escape from the Bubble and why the warriors in the picture can’t step through into the theater.\nButch appears beside his friends after he tricks his way into the theater. The Time Bubble becomes incredibly bright, and suddenly, the warrior appears outside of the Bubble. The interpreter warns the crowd that he’s activating the safeguards in response. Hal blames the anomaly on Butch. \nOne of the warriors grabs a woman in the front row and picks her up. Butch refuses to sit by idly and approaches the warrior with his levitator over his head. When the warrior tries to strike Butch with his sword, he finds that the boy is protected by an invisible shield. Butch commands the uninjes to attack the warriors and their dogs, and they do. The warriors are scared of the uninjes’ strength and their ability to withstand their swords. The warriors’ leader commands them to get back in the Time Bubble. The Interpreter explains that he must collapse the Bubble due to this crisis. The woman who was taken by the warrior hugs and kisses Butch for saving her life. He is very proud of himself. \n", "Butch, Hal, and Joggy, are three kids of varying ages: Joggy is five, Butch is under five, and Hal is older. Butch exhibits a lot of frustration toward their non-violent and heavily age-regimented society. He says he’s going to be World Director, and seems to want to be a dictator like those from the time before humanity conditioned out violence. \n\nButch goes with the other boys to Time in the Round, a place where they can see events from the past and have them explained. Because it is carefully curated for specific ages, Hal tells Butch he won’t be able to enter. Butch tries anyway, but an invisible blockade they call an “usher” won’t let him through. \n\nThe other boys watch a sorcerer and some warriors inside the Time Bubble. Before too long, Butch appears, telling them he lied his way in with a sympathetic adult. Hal is upset that he did this, and also by Butch’s behavior once he’s in there. Though they have been told that it would be impossible for the Time Bubble to be used for time travel, Butch yells at the sorcerer to “sock it to ‘em” and he listens; somehow, between Butch and the sorcerer’s willpower, a few of the warriors end up outside the bubble and in the auditorium, along with their wolves. The interpreter and audience start to panic. \n\nButch takes control, order his and his friends’ uninjs to attack the wolves, who are larger but not invincible like the uninjs. He orders a warrior to put down a lady he has slung over his shoulder and his uninj, Brute, bites the warrior in the ankle, causing him to drop her. Butch tells them to go back where they came from and Brute chases them back into the bubble. Butch calls Brute, and as soon as he jumps back out the bubble dims and goes back to normal. \n\nEveryone is relieved, and the adults are more talkative and less “mature” than usual. People discuss “revised theories” and both the formerly captive woman and Brute embrace and kiss Butch, but he is too dazed and happy to notice. He pets Brute and says “we came, we saw, we conquered, didn’t we, Brute?” \n", "A young boy named Butch plays with his pet--a dog-like, robotic \"uninj\" named Brute--along the Avenue of Wisdom in the Peace Park. Butch is rough with Brute, jabbing and poking him hard with a metal tube, but his friends Joggy and Hal come along and we learn uninjes cannot be harmed nor can they harm. They have been programmed against it. This is just one element in a post-violence world; adults have been systemically programmed against using violence to resolve conflicts between themselves, although they may use it to fight against alien enemies. Butch, however, insists his friends call him \"Butcher\" because he wants to become a dictator when he is older and bring back violence as a means of conflict resolution. His friend Hal assures him that when he is older, he will understand why removing violence from society was \"Man's greatest achievement.\" The boys make their way to the Time Theater at the end of the Avenue of Wisdom by utilizing levitators that help them swim through the air. The Time Theater is home to a large bubble that functions as a one-way viewer into pre-civilization eras. Only people over five years old are allowed into the Time Theater; the Butcher is stopped by an invisible \"usher\", leaving Hal and Joggy to enter the viewing cubicle alone. Once inside, the bubble interpreter and Hal explain to Joggy how the bubble functions. It is essentially a time-hole that allows observation because of light isotopes that leak through. But matter cannot pass through the bubble, which is why it cannot be used for time travel. However, some scientists theorize that people with impulsive minds, such as underage children, might activate a time-traveling capability. The Butcher tricks an adult into carrying him into the Time Theater, and he joins Joggy and Hal in their viewing of a group of barbaric Scandinavian men from the Dawn Era. They watch as a sorcerer conducts some kind of spell with the Butcher egging him on. The Butcher's impulsive behavior combined with the sorcerer's ability to see into the future unlocks the bubble, and the sorcerer pushes the Scandinavian men through into the Time Theater. There, they begin to attack the adults present and attempt to kidnap a woman in the audience. The Butcher commands the uninjes to attack the men, and he stuns them with his use of the levitator to protect his head from the blows of their swords. The uninjes push the men back through the bubble, where they kill the sorcerer and the interpreter closes the bubble. Its automatic safeguards have failed, and the Butcher has saved the day."]}}

The wall gave a little, then\nbounced him back with equal force.\n  \n \n  \"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving\nup, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell\nhow old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you\nthrough a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the\nusher.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_7]\nBut the others had disappeared in the blackness. The Butcher waited and\nthen sat down beside the uninjes. Brute laid his head on his knee and\ngrowled faintly down the corridor.\n  \n \n  \"Take it easy, Brute,\" the Butcher consoled him. \"I don't think\nTamerlane was really a Scand of the Navies anyhow.\"\n  \n \n  Two chattering girls hardly bigger than himself stepped through the\nusher as if it weren't there.\n  \n \n  The Butcher grimly slipped out the metal tube and put it to his lips.\nThere were two closely spaced faint\n   \n   plops\n   \n  and a large green stain\nappeared on the bare back of one girl, while purple fluid dripped from\nthe close-cropped hair of the other.\n  \n \n  They glared at him and one of them said: \"A cub!\" But he had his arms\nfolded and wasn't looking at them.\n  \n \n  Meanwhile, subordinate ushers had guided Hal and Joggy away from the\nmain entrance to the Time Theater. A sphincter dilated and they found\nthemselves in a small transparent cubicle from which they could watch\nthe show without disturbing the adult audience. They unstrapped their\nlevitators, laid them on the floor and sat down.\n  \n \n \n \n  The darkened auditorium was circular. Rising from a low central\nplatform was a huge bubble of light, its lower surface somewhat\nflattened. The audience was seated in concentric rows around the\nbubble, their keen and compassionate faces dimly revealed by the pale\ncentral glow.\n  \n \n  But it was the scene within the bubble that riveted the attention of\nthe boys.\n  \n \n  Great brooding trees, the trunks of the nearer ones sliced by the\nbubble's surface, formed the background. Through the dark, wet foliage\nappeared glimpses of a murky sky, while from the ceiling of the bubble,\na ceaseless rain dripped mournfully. A hooded figure crouched beside a\nlittle fire partly shielded by a gnarled trunk. Squatting round about\nwere wiry, blue-eyed men with shoulder-length blond hair and full blond\nbeards. They were clothed in furs and metal-studded leather.\n  \n \n  Here and there were scattered weapons and armor—long swords glistening\nwith oil to guard them from rust, crudely painted circular shields, and\nhelmets from which curved the horns of beasts. Back and forth, lean,\nwolflike dogs paced with restless monotony.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_12]\nThe warriors inside the bubble stared in stupid astonishment after the\none who had disappeared from their view. The sorcerer leaped about,\npushing them in his direction.\n  \n \n  Abrupt light flooded the Time Theater. The warriors who had emerged\nfrom the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth.\n  \n \n  \"The safeguards are now energized,\" the interpreter said.\n  \n \n  A woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row\nof the audience.\n  \n \n  The first warrior looked her up and down, took one hesitant step\nforward, then another, then suddenly grabbed her and flung her over his\nleft shoulder, looking around menacingly and swinging his sword in his\nright hand.\n  \n \n  \"I repeat, the safeguards have been fully energized! Keep your seats!\"\nthe interpreter enjoined.\n  \n \n  In the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the\nButcher yelled a \"Hey!\" of disapproval, snatched up something from the\nfloor and darted out through the sphincter.\n  \n \n  Here and there in the audience, other adults stood up. The emerged\nwarriors formed a ring of swinging swords and questing eyes. Between\ntheir legs their wolfish dogs, emerged with them, crouched and snarled.\nThen the warriors began to fan out.\n  \n \n  \"There has been an unavoidable delay in energizing the safeguards,\" the\ninterpreter said. \"Please be patient.\"\n  \n \n  At that moment, the Butcher entered the main auditorium, brandishing a\nlevitator above his head and striding purposefully down the aisle. At\nhis heels, five stocky forms trotted. In a definitely pre-civilization\nvoice, or at least with pre-civilization volume, he bellowed: \"Hey,\nyou! You quit that!\"\n  \n \n  The first warrior looked toward him, gave his left shoulder a shake to\nquiet his wriggling captive, gave his right shoulder one to supple his\nsword arm, and waited until the dwarfish challenger came into range.\nThen his sword swished down in a flashing arc.\n  \n \n  Next moment, the Butcher was on his knees and the warrior was staring\nat him open-mouthed. The sword had rebounded from something invisible\nan arm's length above the gnomelike creature's head. The warrior backed\na step.\n  \n \n \n \n  The Butcher stayed down, crouching half behind an aisle seat and\ndigging for something in his pocket. But he didn't stay quiet. \"Sic\n'em, Brute!\" he shrilled. \"Sic 'em, Darter! Sic 'em, Pinkie and Whitie\nand Blue!\" Then he stopped shouting and raised his hand to his mouth.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_10]\nThe Butcher replied airily: \"A red-headed man talked to me and said it\ncertainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes\nof carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater\nand just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but\nthen my sprained ankle had got worse—I kind of tried to get up and\nfell down again—so he picked me up and carried me right through the\nusher.\"\n  \n \n  \"Butcher, that wasn't honest,\" Hal said a little worriedly. \"You\ntricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed\nyours, going through the usher. I really\n   \n   have\n   \n  heard it's dangerous\nfor you under-fives to be in here.\"\n  \n \n  \"The way those cubs beg for babying and get it!\" one of the girls\ncommented. \"Talk about sex favoritism!\" She and her companion withdrew\nto the far end of the cubicle.\n  \n \n  The Butcher grinned at them briefly and concentrated his attention on\nthe scene in the Time Bubble.\n  \n \n  \"Those big dogs—\" he began suddenly. \"Brute must have smelled 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly,\" Hal said. \"Smells can't come out of the Time Bubble.\nSmells haven't any isotopes and—\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted. \"I bet somebody'll figure out\nsomeday how to use the bubble for time traveling.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't travel in a point of view,\" Hal contradicted, \"and that's\nall the bubble is. Besides, some scientists think the bubble isn't real\nat all, but a—uh—\"\n  \n \n  \"I believe,\" the interpreter cut in smoothly, \"that you're thinking\nof the theory that the Time Bubble operates by hypermemory. Some\nscientists would have us believe that all memory is time traveling and\nthat the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but\never-present eternity. Some of them go so far as to state that it is\nonly a mental inability that prevents the Time Bubble from being used\nfor time traveling—just as it may be a similar disability that keeps\na robot with the same or even more scopeful memories from being a real\nman or animal.\n  \n \n  \"It is because of this minority theory that under-age individuals and\nother beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time\nTheater. But do not be alarmed. Even if the minority theory should\nprove true—and no evidence for it has ever appeared—there are\nautomatically operating safeguards to protect the audience from any\nharmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible,\nremember) in either direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sissies!\" was the Butcher's comment.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_13]\nGrowling quite unmechanically, the five uninjes hurled themselves\nforward and closed with the warrior's wolflike dogs. At the first\nencounter, Brute and Pinkie were grabbed by the throats, shaken, and\ntossed a dozen feet. The warriors snarled approval and advanced. But\nthen Brute and Pinkie raced back eagerly to the fight—and suddenly the\nface of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and\ntouched his fingers to it, then looked at his hand in horror.\n  \n \n  The Butcher spared a second to repeat his command to the uninjes. But\nalready the battle was going against the larger dogs. The latter had\nthe advantage of weight and could toss the smaller dogs like so many\nfoxes. But their terrible fangs did no damage, and whenever an uninj\nclamped on a throat, that throat was torn out.\n  \n \n  Meanwhile, great bloody stains had appeared on the bodies of all the\nwarriors. They drew back in a knot, looking at each other fearfully.\nThat was when the Butcher got to his feet and strode forward, hand\nclenching the levitator above his head.\n  \n \n  \"Get back where you belong, you big jerks! And drop that lady!\"\n  \n \n  The first warrior pointed toward him and hissed something. Immediately,\na half dozen swords were smiting at the Butcher.\n  \n \n  \"We are working to energize the safeguards,\" the interpreter said in\nmechanical panic. \"Remain patient and in your seats.\"\n  \n \n  The uninjes leaped into the melee, at first tearing more fur than\nflesh. Swords caught them and sent them spinning through the air. They\ncame yapping back for more. Brute fixed on the first warrior's ankle.\nHe dropped the woman, stamped unavailingly on the uninj, and let out a\nscreech.\n  \n \n  Swords were still rebounding from the invisible shield under which the\nButcher crouched, making terrible faces at his attackers. They drew\nback, looked again at their bloodstains, goggled at the demon dogs.\nAt their leader's screech, they broke and plunged back into the Time\nBubble, their leader stumbling limpingly after them. There they wasted\nno time on their own ragged sorcerer. Their swords rose and fell, and\nno repulsor field stayed them.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, come back!\" the Butcher yelled.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_5]\nIt was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking\nand quite useless against the wind. True, by rocking the repulsor\nhemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would\nbe nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the\nsimplest way to make progress.\n  \n \n  The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were\namong the most prized of toys.\n  \n \n  \"There's the Theater,\" Joggy announced.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   know\n   \n  ,\" the Butcher said irritably.\n  \n \n  But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp\nto the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god\nrealized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to\nthe adults drifting up and down the ramp.\n  \n \n  \"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly\nas he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're\nviewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D.\ntime scale. It should be interesting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will it be about Napoleon?\" the Butcher asked eagerly. \"Or Hitler?\" A\nred-headed adult heard and smiled and paused to watch. A lock of hair\nhad fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat\nJoggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the\ngrim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era.\n  \n \n  \"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  \"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the\nskulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the\nNavies.\"\n  \n \n  Hal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even\nif it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\"\n  \n \n  \"They won't let me in, either.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully.\n  \n \n  \"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the\ndifference.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their\nfeet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened\nhis mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in\ntight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier—like Stalin, maybe, he\nthought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which\ndrank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher\nlimped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his\nbattle injury.\n\n[Chapter: dream_town_9]\nHe\n  was flanked by marble\npillars, thrusting towards\na high-domed ceiling.\n  \n \n  The room stretched long\nand wide before him, the\nwalls bedecked in stunning\npurple draperies.\n  \n \n  He whirled at the sound of\nfootsteps, echoing stridently\non the stone floor. Someone\nwas running towards him.\n  \n \n  It was Sally, pigtails\nstreaming out behind her, the\nsmall body wearing a flowing\nwhite toga. She was shrieking,\nlaughing as she skittered\npast him, clutching a gleaming\ngold helmet.\n  \n \n  He called out to her, but\nshe was too busy outdistancing\nher pursuer. It was Sheriff\nCoogan, puffing and huffing,\nthe metal-and-gold cloth\nuniform ludicrous on his\nlanky frame.\n  \n \n  \"Consarn kid!\" he wheezed.\n\"Gimme my hat!\"\n  \n \n  Mom was following him,\nher stout body regal in scarlet\nrobes. \"Sally! You give\nSir Coogan his helmet! You\nhear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mrs. Dawes!\" Sol said.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Mr. Becker! How\nnice to see you again! Pa!\n   \n   Pa!\n   \n  Look who's here!\"\n  \n \n  Willie Dawes appeared.\n   \n   No!\n   \n  Sol thought. This was\n   \n   King\n   \n  Dawes; nothing else\ncould explain the magnificence\nof his attire.\n  \n \n  \"Yes,\" Dawes said craftily.\n\"So I see. Welcome to Armagon,\nMr. Becker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Armagon?\" Sol gaped.\n\"Then this is the place\nyou've been dreaming about?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yep,\" the King said. \"And\nnow\n   \n   you're\n   \n  in it, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then I'm only dreaming!\"\n  \n \n  Charlie, the fat man,\nclumsy as ever in his robes of\nState, said: \"So\n   \n   that's\n   \n  the\nsnooper, eh?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yep,\" Dawes chuckled.\n\"Think you better round up\nthe Knights.\"\n  \n \n  Sol said: \"The Knights?\"\n  \n \n  \"Exelution! Exelution!\"\nSally shrieked.\n  \n \n  \"Now wait a minute—\"\n  \n \n  Charlie shouted.\n  \n \n  Running feet, clanking of\narmor. Sol backed up against\na pillar. \"Now look here.\nYou've gone far enough—\"\n  \n \n  \"Not quite,\" said the King.\n  \n \n  The Knights stepped forward.\n  \n \n  \"Wait!\" Sol screamed.\n  \n \n  Familiar faces, under shining\nhelmets, moved towards\nhim; the tips of sharp-pointed\nspears gleaming wickedly.\nAnd Sol Becker wondered—would\nhe ever awake?\n  \n \n  Transcriber's Note:\n  \n This etext was produced from\n  \n  Fantastic Universe\n  \n January 1957.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\ncopyright on this publication was renewed.

Jaws gaped to get a hold on necks\nso short and thick as to be mere courtesy terms. They whirled like a\nfanged merry-go-round. Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and\none pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard.\n  \n \n  Butch yawned.\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" inquired Darter's master. \"I thought you liked dog\nfights, Butch.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do like dog fights,\" Butch said somberly, without looking around. \"I\ndon't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else.\nNobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy—and you, too, Hal—when you\ntalk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's not exactly a functional name,\" Hal observed with the\njudiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: \"All\nright, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people\nwere hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly would,\" the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back\nskeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed\nup his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He\nsqueaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.\n  \n \n  \"A kid can't do anything any more,\" he announced dramatically. \"Can't\nbreak anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose.\nCan't get dirty except in the dirt-pen—and they graduate him from that\nwhen he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj—it's contraprogrammed.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?\" Hal asked in a gentle voice\nacquired from a robot adolescer.\n  \n \n  \"I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,\" the\nButcher replied airily. \"A swell book. That guy got dirtier than\nanything.\" His eyes became dreamy. \"He even ate out of a garbage pail.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a garbage pail?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, but it sounds great.\"\n  \n \n  The battling uninjes careened into them. Brute had Darter by the ear\nand was whirling him around hilariously.\n  \n \n  \"Aw,\n   \n   quit\n   \n  it, Brute,\" the Butcher said in annoyance.\n  \n \n  Brute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no\nattention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight.\n  \n \n  The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. \"You're making too much\nof a rumpus,\" he said. \"I want to think.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_4]\nThe others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Butch scowled.\n  \n \n  \"How about it, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Still Butch did not seem to hear.\n  \n \n  The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it—Butcher?\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You\nsaid so yourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could walk us over there.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\"\n  \n \n  \"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n  \n \n  He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n  \n \n  With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n  \n \n  Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n  \n \n  \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n  \n \n  Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n  \n \n  Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_11]\n\"You're rather young to be here, aren't you?\" the interpreter inquired.\n  \n \n \n \n  The Butcher folded his arms and scowled.\n  \n \n  The interpreter hesitated almost humanly, probably snatching through a\nquarter-million microtapes. \"Well, you wouldn't have got in unless a\nqualified adult had certified you as plus-age. Enjoy yourself.\"\n  \n \n  There was no need for the last injunction. The scene within the bubble\nhad acquired a gripping interest. The shaggy warriors were taking up\ntheir swords, gathering about the hooded sorcerer. The hood fell back,\nrevealing a face with hawklike, disturbing eyes that seemed to be\nlooking straight out of the bubble at the future.\n  \n \n  \"This is getting good,\" the Butcher said, squirming toward the edge of\nhis seat.\n  \n \n  \"Stop being an impulsive mentality,\" Hal warned him a little nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Hah!\"\n  \n \n  The sorcerer emptied the small bag on the fire and a thick cloud of\nsmoke puffed toward the ceiling of the bubble. A clawlike hand waved\nwildly. The sorcerer appeared to be expostulating, commanding. The\nwarriors stared uncomprehendingly, which seemed to exasperate the\nsorcerer.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" the Butcher approved loudly. \"Sock it to 'em!\"\n  \n \n  \"Butcher!\" Hal admonished.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the bubble grew very bright, as if the Sun had just shone\nforth in the ancient world, though the rain still dripped down.\n  \n \n  \"A viewing anomaly has occurred,\" the interpreter announced. \"It may be\nnecessary to collapse the Time Bubble for a short period.\"\n  \n \n  In a frenzy, his ragged robes twisting like smoke, the sorcerer rushed\nat one of the warriors, pushing him backward so that in a moment he\nmust cross-section.\n  \n \n  \"Attaboy!\" the Butcher encouraged.\n  \n \n  Then the warrior was standing outside the bubble, blinking toward the\nshadows, rain dripping from his beard and furs.\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\n   \n   boy\n   \n  !\" the Butcher cheered in ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Butcher, you've done it!\" Hal said, aghast.\n  \n \n  \"I sure did,\" the Butcher agreed blandly, \"but that old guy in the\nbubble helped me. Must take two to work it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep your seats!\" the interpreter said loudly. \"We are energizing the\nsafeguards!\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_3]\nHe kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" Joggy said, \"you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?\" the Butcher demanded\nscathingly. \"An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits\nand a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.\" He looked at Brute with\nguarded wistfulness.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know about that,\" Hal put in. \"I've heard an uninj is\nprogrammed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically\nhas racial memory.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean if you\n   \n   could\n   \n  hurt an uninj,\" Joggy amended.\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I wouldn't,\" the Butcher admitted grudgingly. \"But shut\nup—I want to think.\"\n  \n \n  \"About what?\" Hal asked with saintly reasonableness.\n  \n \n  The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. \"When I'm World Director,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"I'm going to have warfare again.\"\n  \n \n  \"You think so now,\" Hal told him. \"We all do at your age.\"\n  \n \n  \"We do not,\" the Butcher retorted. \"I bet\n   \n   you\n   \n  didn't.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,\" the older boy confessed readily. \"All\nnewborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless.\nThey have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death\ngames and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult\nconditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why,\nlong after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people\nkept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them\ndifferently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's\ngreatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all\nviolent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will not!\" the Butcher countered hotly. \"I'm not going to be a\nsissy.\" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. \"And what if we\nwere attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Space Fleet would take care of them,\" Hal replied calmly. \"That's\nwhat it's for. Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to\nproblems where non-human enemies are concerned. Look at what we did to\nviruses.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what if somebody got at us through the Time Bubble?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't. It's impossible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but suppose they did all the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've never been inside the Time Theater—you're not old enough\nyet—so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons\nwhy it's impossible,\" Hal replied with friendly factuality. \"The Time\nBubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into\nthe past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't\nchange the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted obstinately. \"I'm still going to\nhave warfare when I'm World Director.\"\n  \n \n  \"They'll condition you out of the idea,\" Hal assured him.\n  \n \n  \"They will not. I won't let 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't matter what you think now,\" Hal said with finality. \"You'll\nhave an altogether different opinion when you're six.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what if I will?\" the Butcher snapped back. \"You don't have to\nkeep\n   \n   telling\n   \n  me about it, do you?\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_9]\nAs if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on\ntheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For\nan instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing\nsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the\nbubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the\nback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on\nthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some\ntime.\n  \n \n  He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.\n  \n \n  \"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice\ncut in.\n  \n \n  Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the\ncubicle.

Then a small boy caught up\nwith the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the\nscene was normal again.\n  \n \n  The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied\nthe dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and\npoked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his\ngrip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony\npavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip\nand suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff\ntube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an\nupside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long\nblack tongue lolled.\n  \n \n  The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube\nwith a grimace of utter disgust.

He acts as a mentor to the Butcher and Joggy, the other two boys. Joggy is five, so he is able to go to the Time Theater for the first time, but the Butcher is not yet old enough. Hal tells the Butcher that his violent impulses will pass given time and conditioning, and tries to dissuade him from trying to enter the TIme Theater for the sake of safety. He is the one that wants to go to the theater, and asks the Butcher to walk with him. He scolds the Butcher once he reveals how he snuck into the theater, and is worried about the potential danger. Throughout the time in the theater, it is Hal who explains how the different beings in the society fit together, and the technology (and theories) around the Time Bubble, though the electronic narrator in the viewing box at the theater also helps fill in some details. Throughout the story more broadly, Hal maintains a patient tone with the Butcher, as he tries to be very understanding about his youthful inclinations towards violence, admitting his past urges but pointing towards positive change towards a more calm mindset. ", "Hal is Butch and Joggy’s older friend. He knows a lot more about the Time Bubble and pre-civilization than his younger friends do. Hal is reasonable, patient, and conditioned by the society he is a part of. He agrees with the rules that govern his existence and understands the key differences between pre-civilization and now. Hal is kind to Butch even when he rebels or tries to act like he knows better than everyone else. When Butch tells his friends that he will start wars when he serves as World Director, Hal responds by telling him that everyone thinks that at his age. Hal is confident in his knowledge of the world and society and does not get frustrated with Butch’s fantastical ideas. \n\nHal enjoys his trips to the Time Theater and it’s his suggestion that convinces Joggy and Butch to go see the Time Bubble. He thinks that the Scandinavian warriors sound interesting. He agrees that Butch should walk him and Joggy there, but he is certain that Butch will not be allowed into the theater. Hal is convinced that an usher will stop Butch from entering, and he believes that allowing someone under the age of five to enter the sacred hall could be dangerous. \n\nHal tries to answer all of Joggy’s questions about the Time Bubble, but the truth is he doesn’t understand a lot of the mechanisms behind the mysterious machine. He is a little bit embarrassed when the interpreter has to keep responding to Joggy throughout the show. Hal is truly alarmed when Butch shows up unexpectedly in the transparent cubicle. He thinks it is immoral and wrong to convince the usher that he is older than he truly is, and he worries that there will be severe consequences for his actions. When the Scandinavian warrior comes out of the Time Bubble and becomes violent, Hal immediately blames Butch for the glitch. He is a rule follower, and regardless of the fact that Butch saved the day, he remains upset and angry at him for breaking protocol in the first place. \n", "Hal is an older boy in the story, and he likes to remind his younger friends of his age and wisdom. He is more mature and sees the reasoning behind a lot of the rules that frustrate Butch, but his constant refrain of telling Butch that he’ll feel differently when he’s older only serves to irritate the younger boy and make him want to act out even more. Hal tells Butch that it’s dangerous for under-fives to be in the Time Room, and he grows increasingly frustrated with and anxious about Butch’s behavior when he lies his way in and starts messing with the Time Bubble. \n", "Hal is the oldest of the three friends, and he seems to understand the most about how the Time Theater functions and how the bubble works. Whereas Butch is impulsive, impatient, and wants to use violence to solve problems, Hal is more adjusted to the standards of the post-violence society. He offers wise counsel to Butch, who resists him at every turn, and he educates Joggy, who is more eager to absorb the lessons he imparts. Hal contrasts pre-civilization with the current world they live in and suggests that with age, Butch will also understand the necessity of removing violence from the equation when it comes to resolving conflict.

Thank you for your patience.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n  \n \n  \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n  \n \n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_12]\nThe warriors inside the bubble stared in stupid astonishment after the\none who had disappeared from their view. The sorcerer leaped about,\npushing them in his direction.\n  \n \n  Abrupt light flooded the Time Theater. The warriors who had emerged\nfrom the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth.\n  \n \n  \"The safeguards are now energized,\" the interpreter said.\n  \n \n  A woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row\nof the audience.\n  \n \n  The first warrior looked her up and down, took one hesitant step\nforward, then another, then suddenly grabbed her and flung her over his\nleft shoulder, looking around menacingly and swinging his sword in his\nright hand.\n  \n \n  \"I repeat, the safeguards have been fully energized! Keep your seats!\"\nthe interpreter enjoined.\n  \n \n  In the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the\nButcher yelled a \"Hey!\" of disapproval, snatched up something from the\nfloor and darted out through the sphincter.\n  \n \n  Here and there in the audience, other adults stood up. The emerged\nwarriors formed a ring of swinging swords and questing eyes. Between\ntheir legs their wolfish dogs, emerged with them, crouched and snarled.\nThen the warriors began to fan out.\n  \n \n  \"There has been an unavoidable delay in energizing the safeguards,\" the\ninterpreter said. \"Please be patient.\"\n  \n \n  At that moment, the Butcher entered the main auditorium, brandishing a\nlevitator above his head and striding purposefully down the aisle. At\nhis heels, five stocky forms trotted. In a definitely pre-civilization\nvoice, or at least with pre-civilization volume, he bellowed: \"Hey,\nyou! You quit that!\"\n  \n \n  The first warrior looked toward him, gave his left shoulder a shake to\nquiet his wriggling captive, gave his right shoulder one to supple his\nsword arm, and waited until the dwarfish challenger came into range.\nThen his sword swished down in a flashing arc.\n  \n \n  Next moment, the Butcher was on his knees and the warrior was staring\nat him open-mouthed. The sword had rebounded from something invisible\nan arm's length above the gnomelike creature's head. The warrior backed\na step.\n  \n \n \n \n  The Butcher stayed down, crouching half behind an aisle seat and\ndigging for something in his pocket. But he didn't stay quiet. \"Sic\n'em, Brute!\" he shrilled. \"Sic 'em, Darter! Sic 'em, Pinkie and Whitie\nand Blue!\" Then he stopped shouting and raised his hand to his mouth.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_7]\nBut the others had disappeared in the blackness. The Butcher waited and\nthen sat down beside the uninjes. Brute laid his head on his knee and\ngrowled faintly down the corridor.\n  \n \n  \"Take it easy, Brute,\" the Butcher consoled him. \"I don't think\nTamerlane was really a Scand of the Navies anyhow.\"\n  \n \n  Two chattering girls hardly bigger than himself stepped through the\nusher as if it weren't there.\n  \n \n  The Butcher grimly slipped out the metal tube and put it to his lips.\nThere were two closely spaced faint\n   \n   plops\n   \n  and a large green stain\nappeared on the bare back of one girl, while purple fluid dripped from\nthe close-cropped hair of the other.\n  \n \n  They glared at him and one of them said: \"A cub!\" But he had his arms\nfolded and wasn't looking at them.\n  \n \n  Meanwhile, subordinate ushers had guided Hal and Joggy away from the\nmain entrance to the Time Theater. A sphincter dilated and they found\nthemselves in a small transparent cubicle from which they could watch\nthe show without disturbing the adult audience. They unstrapped their\nlevitators, laid them on the floor and sat down.\n  \n \n \n \n  The darkened auditorium was circular. Rising from a low central\nplatform was a huge bubble of light, its lower surface somewhat\nflattened. The audience was seated in concentric rows around the\nbubble, their keen and compassionate faces dimly revealed by the pale\ncentral glow.\n  \n \n  But it was the scene within the bubble that riveted the attention of\nthe boys.\n  \n \n  Great brooding trees, the trunks of the nearer ones sliced by the\nbubble's surface, formed the background. Through the dark, wet foliage\nappeared glimpses of a murky sky, while from the ceiling of the bubble,\na ceaseless rain dripped mournfully. A hooded figure crouched beside a\nlittle fire partly shielded by a gnarled trunk. Squatting round about\nwere wiry, blue-eyed men with shoulder-length blond hair and full blond\nbeards. They were clothed in furs and metal-studded leather.\n  \n \n  Here and there were scattered weapons and armor—long swords glistening\nwith oil to guard them from rust, crudely painted circular shields, and\nhelmets from which curved the horns of beasts. Back and forth, lean,\nwolflike dogs paced with restless monotony.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_5]\nIt was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking\nand quite useless against the wind. True, by rocking the repulsor\nhemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would\nbe nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the\nsimplest way to make progress.\n  \n \n  The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were\namong the most prized of toys.\n  \n \n  \"There's the Theater,\" Joggy announced.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   know\n   \n  ,\" the Butcher said irritably.\n  \n \n  But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp\nto the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god\nrealized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to\nthe adults drifting up and down the ramp.\n  \n \n  \"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly\nas he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're\nviewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D.\ntime scale. It should be interesting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will it be about Napoleon?\" the Butcher asked eagerly. \"Or Hitler?\" A\nred-headed adult heard and smiled and paused to watch. A lock of hair\nhad fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat\nJoggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the\ngrim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era.\n  \n \n  \"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  \"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the\nskulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the\nNavies.\"\n  \n \n  Hal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even\nif it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\"\n  \n \n  \"They won't let me in, either.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully.\n  \n \n  \"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the\ndifference.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their\nfeet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened\nhis mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in\ntight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier—like Stalin, maybe, he\nthought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which\ndrank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher\nlimped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his\nbattle injury.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_4]\nThe others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Butch scowled.\n  \n \n  \"How about it, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Still Butch did not seem to hear.\n  \n \n  The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it—Butcher?\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You\nsaid so yourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could walk us over there.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\"\n  \n \n  \"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n  \n \n  He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n  \n \n  With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n  \n \n  Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n  \n \n  \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n  \n \n  Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n  \n \n  Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_3]\nHe kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" Joggy said, \"you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?\" the Butcher demanded\nscathingly. \"An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits\nand a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.\" He looked at Brute with\nguarded wistfulness.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know about that,\" Hal put in. \"I've heard an uninj is\nprogrammed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically\nhas racial memory.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean if you\n   \n   could\n   \n  hurt an uninj,\" Joggy amended.\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I wouldn't,\" the Butcher admitted grudgingly. \"But shut\nup—I want to think.\"\n  \n \n  \"About what?\" Hal asked with saintly reasonableness.\n  \n \n  The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. \"When I'm World Director,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"I'm going to have warfare again.\"\n  \n \n  \"You think so now,\" Hal told him. \"We all do at your age.\"\n  \n \n  \"We do not,\" the Butcher retorted. \"I bet\n   \n   you\n   \n  didn't.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,\" the older boy confessed readily. \"All\nnewborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless.\nThey have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death\ngames and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult\nconditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why,\nlong after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people\nkept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them\ndifferently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's\ngreatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all\nviolent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will not!\" the Butcher countered hotly. \"I'm not going to be a\nsissy.\" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. \"And what if we\nwere attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Space Fleet would take care of them,\" Hal replied calmly. \"That's\nwhat it's for. Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to\nproblems where non-human enemies are concerned. Look at what we did to\nviruses.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what if somebody got at us through the Time Bubble?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't. It's impossible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but suppose they did all the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've never been inside the Time Theater—you're not old enough\nyet—so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons\nwhy it's impossible,\" Hal replied with friendly factuality. \"The Time\nBubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into\nthe past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't\nchange the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted obstinately. \"I'm still going to\nhave warfare when I'm World Director.\"\n  \n \n  \"They'll condition you out of the idea,\" Hal assured him.\n  \n \n  \"They will not. I won't let 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't matter what you think now,\" Hal said with finality. \"You'll\nhave an altogether different opinion when you're six.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what if I will?\" the Butcher snapped back. \"You don't have to\nkeep\n   \n   telling\n   \n  me about it, do you?\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_9]\nAs if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on\ntheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For\nan instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing\nsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the\nbubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the\nback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on\nthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some\ntime.\n  \n \n  He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.\n  \n \n  \"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice\ncut in.\n  \n \n  Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the\ncubicle. One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand while\nmopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other.\n  \n \n  Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: \"Butch!\"\n  \n \n  But Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble.\n  \n \n  \"Then how is it, Hal,\" he asked, \"that light comes out of the bubble,\nif the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks toward\nus, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the light\ncoming our way disappear, too?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well—you see, Joggy, it isn't real light. It's—\"\n  \n \n  Once more the interpreter helped him out.\n  \n \n  \"The light that comes from the bubble is an isotope.

Incidentally, no\nisotopes have been discovered that leak pastward, though attempts are\nbeing made to synthesize them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, explanations!\" murmured one of the newly arrived girls. \"The cubs\nare always angling for them.

His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to\nretreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed\nback to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound\nissued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other\nuninjes moved uneasily.\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy\nwhispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still\nfixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.\n  \n \n  The three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely\nelectrical tingling that vanished almost immediately.

For a moment, the\neffect was almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of\ncivilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy caught up\nwith the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the\nscene was normal again.\n  \n \n  The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied\nthe dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and\npoked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his\ngrip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony\npavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip\nand suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff\ntube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an\nupside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long\nblack tongue lolled.\n  \n \n  The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube\nwith a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone\ncalled: \"Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em!\"\n  \n \n  A larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the\nluxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that,\nexcept for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog.\n  \n \n  Butch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice:\n\"Kill 'em, Brute.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_10]\nThe Butcher replied airily: \"A red-headed man talked to me and said it\ncertainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes\nof carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater\nand just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but\nthen my sprained ankle had got worse—I kind of tried to get up and\nfell down again—so he picked me up and carried me right through the\nusher.\"\n  \n \n  \"Butcher, that wasn't honest,\" Hal said a little worriedly. \"You\ntricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed\nyours, going through the usher. I really\n   \n   have\n   \n  heard it's dangerous\nfor you under-fives to be in here.\"\n  \n \n  \"The way those cubs beg for babying and get it!\" one of the girls\ncommented. \"Talk about sex favoritism!\" She and her companion withdrew\nto the far end of the cubicle.\n  \n \n  The Butcher grinned at them briefly and concentrated his attention on\nthe scene in the Time Bubble.\n  \n \n  \"Those big dogs—\" he began suddenly. \"Brute must have smelled 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly,\" Hal said. \"Smells can't come out of the Time Bubble.\nSmells haven't any isotopes and—\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted. \"I bet somebody'll figure out\nsomeday how to use the bubble for time traveling.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't travel in a point of view,\" Hal contradicted, \"and that's\nall the bubble is. Besides, some scientists think the bubble isn't real\nat all, but a—uh—\"\n  \n \n  \"I believe,\" the interpreter cut in smoothly, \"that you're thinking\nof the theory that the Time Bubble operates by hypermemory. Some\nscientists would have us believe that all memory is time traveling and\nthat the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but\never-present eternity. Some of them go so far as to state that it is\nonly a mental inability that prevents the Time Bubble from being used\nfor time traveling—just as it may be a similar disability that keeps\na robot with the same or even more scopeful memories from being a real\nman or animal.\n  \n \n  \"It is because of this minority theory that under-age individuals and\nother beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time\nTheater. But do not be alarmed. Even if the minority theory should\nprove true—and no evidence for it has ever appeared—there are\nautomatically operating safeguards to protect the audience from any\nharmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible,\nremember) in either direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sissies!\" was the Butcher's comment.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_2]\nThe gray dog hurled itself on Darter. Jaws gaped to get a hold on necks\nso short and thick as to be mere courtesy terms. They whirled like a\nfanged merry-go-round. Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and\none pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard.\n  \n \n  Butch yawned.\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" inquired Darter's master. \"I thought you liked dog\nfights, Butch.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do like dog fights,\" Butch said somberly, without looking around. \"I\ndon't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else.\nNobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy—and you, too, Hal—when you\ntalk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's not exactly a functional name,\" Hal observed with the\njudiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: \"All\nright, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people\nwere hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly would,\" the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back\nskeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed\nup his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He\nsqueaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.\n  \n \n  \"A kid can't do anything any more,\" he announced dramatically. \"Can't\nbreak anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose.\nCan't get dirty except in the dirt-pen—and they graduate him from that\nwhen he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj—it's contraprogrammed.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?\" Hal asked in a gentle voice\nacquired from a robot adolescer.\n  \n \n  \"I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,\" the\nButcher replied airily. \"A swell book. That guy got dirtier than\nanything.\" His eyes became dreamy. \"He even ate out of a garbage pail.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a garbage pail?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, but it sounds great.\"\n  \n \n  The battling uninjes careened into them. Brute had Darter by the ear\nand was whirling him around hilariously.\n  \n \n  \"Aw,\n   \n   quit\n   \n  it, Brute,\" the Butcher said in annoyance.\n  \n \n  Brute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no\nattention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight.\n  \n \n  The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. \"You're making too much\nof a rumpus,\" he said. \"I want to think.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_11]\n\"You're rather young to be here, aren't you?\" the interpreter inquired.\n  \n \n \n \n  The Butcher folded his arms and scowled.\n  \n \n  The interpreter hesitated almost humanly, probably snatching through a\nquarter-million microtapes. \"Well, you wouldn't have got in unless a\nqualified adult had certified you as plus-age. Enjoy yourself.\"\n  \n \n  There was no need for the last injunction. The scene within the bubble\nhad acquired a gripping interest. The shaggy warriors were taking up\ntheir swords, gathering about the hooded sorcerer. The hood fell back,\nrevealing a face with hawklike, disturbing eyes that seemed to be\nlooking straight out of the bubble at the future.\n  \n \n  \"This is getting good,\" the Butcher said, squirming toward the edge of\nhis seat.\n  \n \n  \"Stop being an impulsive mentality,\" Hal warned him a little nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Hah!\"\n  \n \n  The sorcerer emptied the small bag on the fire and a thick cloud of\nsmoke puffed toward the ceiling of the bubble. A clawlike hand waved\nwildly. The sorcerer appeared to be expostulating, commanding. The\nwarriors stared uncomprehendingly, which seemed to exasperate the\nsorcerer.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" the Butcher approved loudly. \"Sock it to 'em!\"\n  \n \n  \"Butcher!\" Hal admonished.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the bubble grew very bright, as if the Sun had just shone\nforth in the ancient world, though the rain still dripped down.\n  \n \n  \"A viewing anomaly has occurred,\" the interpreter announced. \"It may be\nnecessary to collapse the Time Bubble for a short period.\"\n  \n \n  In a frenzy, his ragged robes twisting like smoke, the sorcerer rushed\nat one of the warriors, pushing him backward so that in a moment he\nmust cross-section.\n  \n \n  \"Attaboy!\" the Butcher encouraged.\n  \n \n  Then the warrior was standing outside the bubble, blinking toward the\nshadows, rain dripping from his beard and furs.\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\n   \n   boy\n   \n  !\" the Butcher cheered in ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Butcher, you've done it!\" Hal said, aghast.\n  \n \n  \"I sure did,\" the Butcher agreed blandly, \"but that old guy in the\nbubble helped me. Must take two to work it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep your seats!\" the interpreter said loudly. \"We are energizing the\nsafeguards!\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_8]\nSometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway—for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped—and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why—er—you see, Joggy—\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_13]\nGrowling quite unmechanically, the five uninjes hurled themselves\nforward and closed with the warrior's wolflike dogs. At the first\nencounter, Brute and Pinkie were grabbed by the throats, shaken, and\ntossed a dozen feet. The warriors snarled approval and advanced. But\nthen Brute and Pinkie raced back eagerly to the fight—and suddenly the\nface of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and\ntouched his fingers to it, then looked at his hand in horror.\n  \n \n  The Butcher spared a second to repeat his command to the uninjes. But\nalready the battle was going against the larger dogs. The latter had\nthe advantage of weight and could toss the smaller dogs like so many\nfoxes. But their terrible fangs did no damage, and whenever an uninj\nclamped on a throat, that throat was torn out.\n  \n \n  Meanwhile, great bloody stains had appeared on the bodies of all the\nwarriors. They drew back in a knot, looking at each other fearfully.\nThat was when the Butcher got to his feet and strode forward, hand\nclenching the levitator above his head.\n  \n \n  \"Get back where you belong, you big jerks! And drop that lady!\"\n  \n \n  The first warrior pointed toward him and hissed something. Immediately,\na half dozen swords were smiting at the Butcher.\n  \n \n  \"We are working to energize the safeguards,\" the interpreter said in\nmechanical panic. \"Remain patient and in your seats.\"\n  \n \n  The uninjes leaped into the melee, at first tearing more fur than\nflesh. Swords caught them and sent them spinning through the air. They\ncame yapping back for more. Brute fixed on the first warrior's ankle.\nHe dropped the woman, stamped unavailingly on the uninj, and let out a\nscreech.\n  \n \n  Swords were still rebounding from the invisible shield under which the\nButcher crouched, making terrible faces at his attackers. They drew\nback, looked again at their bloodstains, goggled at the demon dogs.\nAt their leader's screech, they broke and plunged back into the Time\nBubble, their leader stumbling limpingly after them. There they wasted\nno time on their own ragged sorcerer. Their swords rose and fell, and\nno repulsor field stayed them.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, come back!\" the Butcher yelled.\n\n[Chapter: THE_MAN_OUTSIDE_4]\nWhen Martin was sixteen, Raymond took him aside for the talk Ninian had\npromised five years before.\n  \n \n  \"The whole thing's all my brother Conrad's fault. You see, he's an\nidealist,\" Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.\n  \n \n  Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and\nrather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery\nstore or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized\nand he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear\nglasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun,\nand his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having\ncarefully eradicated all current vulgarities.\n  \n \n  \"And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting\nthe not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,\" Raymond\ncontinued. \"Which\n   \n   is\n   \n  distressing—though, of course, it's not as\nif they were people. Besides, the government has been talking about\npassing laws to do away with the—well, abuses and things like that,\nand I'm sure someday everything will come out all right. However,\nConrad is so impatient.\"\n  \n \n  \"I thought, in your world, machines did all the work,\" Martin suggested.\n  \n \n  \"I've told you—our world is precisely the same as this one!\" Raymond\nsnapped. \"We just come a couple of centuries or so later, that's all.\nBut remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same\npeople ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd\nyears of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?\"\n  \n \n  He continued more mildly: \"However, even you ought to be able to\nunderstand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food.\nAll that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those\nworlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that\nexpensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how\nwould they manage to live?\"\n  \n \n  \"How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how\ndo\n   \n   you\n   \n  live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for\nyou,\" Martin explained laboriously.

They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated\nyoung people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and\nconsiderable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And\nhe had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the\nlot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or—more\nfrightening—his race had lost something vital.\n  \n \n  Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him,\nRaymond went on blandly: \"Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to\nfeel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for\nthe fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we\nmight never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous—his feeling\nguilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his\ngreat-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held\naccountable for his great-grandfather.\"\n  \n \n  \"How about a great-great-grandchild?\" Martin couldn't help asking.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This futuristic society is structured around the systematic conditioning of its members to eliminate interpersonal violence, a process that begins in childhood and solidifies around the age of six.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  The society believes that children are born with natural, aggressive impulses. To manage these impulses before \"adult conditioning\" takes hold, they provide specific outlets. The older boy, Hal, explains that tools like robotic dogs (\"uninjes\"), \"death games,\" and \"fear houses\" are designed to channel these tendencies constructively.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death games and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult conditioning.\n    ##end_quote##\n\n2.

Before this conditioning, children are provided with outlets for their natural aggression, such as uninjurable robotic dogs (\"uninjes\"), \"death games,\" and \"fear houses.\" This societal pacifism is limited to human interactions, as violence is still deemed acceptable against non-human threats like viruses or alien invaders. Access to advanced technology like the Time Theater is strictly controlled by age, with children under five being barred due to their \"impulsive mentalities,\" which are considered a potential danger."}], "metadata": {"id": "278", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["This society is organized around a reconditioning of thoughts that happens as children transition into adulthood, starting at age six. Adults who have already been reconditioned are passive and polite members of society, who supposedly do not have traces of violent tendencies anymore. Before this, however, there are a few levels of separation from the rest of the society. Five year olds are allowed to go to the Time Theater to view whatever is showing through the Time Bubble, a view into other societies throughout time, but anyone younger than five is not allowed. This is presumably because of safety concerns--Hal thinks that young children are a nuisance to adults in these settings. The society has a number of systems in place specifically for these younger children who have not yet been conditioned. There are things called death games and fear houses, which we do not see details of in this story, that are meant to clear out the childrens' emotional space. It also seems that uninjes, the robotic dogs that the boys have, are also for this purpose: Hal says that they are part of the society's options for letting kids work out their ruthless and inconsiderate impulses. These impulses are restructured when they are aimed at other people, but violent alien beings and viruses or other medical concerns are still considered threats worth responding to in full force. The particular focus on avoiding violent patterns seen in other civilizations is highlighted by the grand nature of the Time Theater, and its position at the end of a major street in a large public park.", "In “Time in the Round,” the society is structured around perfection. Small children are given breakables, and those items are the only things that are physically capable of being broken. There are dirt-pens for kids to play in, and besides those areas, children are incapable of becoming dirty. The dirt-pens are only available to children aged 2 and younger. The society’s dogs, uninjes, are programmed not to bite or hurt the people, even when they are hit or stabbed themselves. They do not react like normal canines. \n\nYoung children are considered to be self-centered and ruthless, and they are provided with death games and fear houses to get out their emotions and prepare to be conditioned as adults. When children turn six years old, they feel differently than they did before. They are ready to enter the Time Theater and view the Time Bubble. They are taught about pre-civilization and the important differences between their own society and the past. They learn how to reject violent solutions to problems and live in peace. \n", "The structure of society is based on age, and very specific behaviors are allowed and prohibited at different ages. Very young children are allowed to play and get dirty, but after a certain age they are no longer allowed to do so. Certain ages are considered too young for certain ideas, and aren’t allowed in the Time Building or are only allowed in certain parts of it. Younger children are sometimes called “cubs”, and it seems to be commonplace for older members of society to treat younger members with sweet derision. This society puts a strong emphasis on maturity and carefully controls what people are allowed to do at what ages and when they are allowed to learn concepts or do activities. The core principle is nonviolence but the results are near-total uniformity and strict constraints. \n", "The society the main characters inhabit is post-violence. While children below five are given uninjes, death games, and fear houses in order to clear their emotions, adults are systematically re-programmed to believe that violence has no place in this new society. While violence is never used to resolve conflicts between humans, the Space Fleet will still use violence in defense against alien enemies. There are a number of protections in place to prevent violence upon humans from repulsor shields to the protective uninjes. The bubble at the Time Theater offers adults and those with the appropriate mental facilities a view into the pre-civilization world so that they may learn from the past and understand why a lack of violence became necessary in the new society."]}}

Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and\none pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard.\n  \n \n  Butch yawned.\n  \n \n  \"What's the matter?\" inquired Darter's master. \"I thought you liked dog\nfights, Butch.\"\n  \n \n  \"I do like dog fights,\" Butch said somberly, without looking around. \"I\ndon't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else.\nNobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy—and you, too, Hal—when you\ntalk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's not exactly a functional name,\" Hal observed with the\njudiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: \"All\nright, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people\nwere hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\"\n  \n \n  \"I certainly would,\" the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back\nskeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed\nup his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He\nsqueaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.\n  \n \n  \"A kid can't do anything any more,\" he announced dramatically. \"Can't\nbreak anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose.\nCan't get dirty except in the dirt-pen—and they graduate him from that\nwhen he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj—it's contraprogrammed.\"\n  \n \n  \"Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?\" Hal asked in a gentle voice\nacquired from a robot adolescer.\n  \n \n  \"I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,\" the\nButcher replied airily. \"A swell book. That guy got dirtier than\nanything.\" His eyes became dreamy. \"He even ate out of a garbage pail.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's a garbage pail?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know, but it sounds great.\"\n  \n \n  The battling uninjes careened into them. Brute had Darter by the ear\nand was whirling him around hilariously.\n  \n \n  \"Aw,\n   \n   quit\n   \n  it, Brute,\" the Butcher said in annoyance.\n  \n \n  Brute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no\nattention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight.\n  \n \n  The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. \"You're making too much\nof a rumpus,\" he said. \"I want to think.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_6]\nHal looked back. \"Honestly, the usher will stop you.\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher shook his head. \"I'm going to think my way in. I'm going to\nthink old.\"\n  \n \n  \"You won't be able to fool the usher, Butcher. You under-fives\nsimply aren't allowed in the Time Theater. There's a good reason for\nit—something dangerous might happen if an under-five got inside.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't exactly know, but something.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hah! I bet they're scared we'd go traveling in the Time Bubble and\nhave some excitement.\"\n  \n \n  \"They are not. I guess they just know you'd get bored and wander away\nfrom your seats and maybe disturb the adults or upset the electronics\nor something. But don't worry about it, Butcher. The usher will take\ncare of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up—I'm thinking I'm World Director,\" the Butcher informed them,\ncontorting his face diabolically.\n  \n \n  Hal spoke to the uninjes, pointing to the side of the corridor.\nObediently four of them lined up.\n  \n \n  But Brute was peering down the corridor toward where it merged into a\ndeeper darkness. His short legs stiffened, his neckless head seemed to\nretreat even further between his powerful shoulders, his lips writhed\nback to show his gleaming fangs, and a completely unfamiliar sound\nissued from his throat. A choked, grating sound. A growl. The other\nuninjes moved uneasily.\n  \n \n  \"Do you suppose something's the matter with his circuits?\" Joggy\nwhispered. \"Maybe he's getting racial memories from the Scands.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not,\" Hal said irritably.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, get over there,\" the Butcher commanded. Unwillingly, eyes still\nfixed on the blackness ahead, Brute obeyed.\n  \n \n  The three boys started on. Hal and Joggy experienced a vaguely\nelectrical tingling that vanished almost immediately. They looked back.\nThe Butcher had been stopped by an invisible wall.\n  \n \n  \"I told you you couldn't fool the usher,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  The Butcher hurled himself forward. The wall gave a little, then\nbounced him back with equal force.\n  \n \n  \"I bet it'll be a bum time view anyway,\" the Butcher said, not giving\nup, but not trying again. \"And I still don't think the usher can tell\nhow old you are. I bet there's an over-age teacher spying on you\nthrough a hole, and if he doesn't like your looks, he switches on the\nusher.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_4]\nThe others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly\non the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said\nin soothing tones: \"Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time\nTheater. Want to walk us there, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Butch scowled.\n  \n \n  \"How about it, Butch?\"\n  \n \n  Still Butch did not seem to hear.\n  \n \n  The older boy shrugged and said: \"Oh, well, how about it—Butcher?\"\n  \n \n  The Butcher swung around. \"They won't let me in the Time Theater. You\nsaid so yourself.\"\n  \n \n  \"You could walk us over there.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.\"\n  \n \n  \"While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging\npocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a\nblack mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.\n  \n \n  He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups\nwanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up\nor tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the\ncrayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF\nTHE GRASS.\n  \n \n  With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the\nothers.\n  \n \n  Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at\nshoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a\nwide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes\navoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking\nup inquiringly at his master.\n  \n \n  \"Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!\" the Butcher called. The older boy\nignored him. \"Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, all right.\" Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of\nhis broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher\nclimbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during\nwhich each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.\n  \n \n  Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along\nsecurely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after\nhis master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few\nminutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to\nclimb the hemispherical repulsor field.\n  \n \n  Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the\nAvenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he\nwas about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_13]\nGrowling quite unmechanically, the five uninjes hurled themselves\nforward and closed with the warrior's wolflike dogs. At the first\nencounter, Brute and Pinkie were grabbed by the throats, shaken, and\ntossed a dozen feet. The warriors snarled approval and advanced. But\nthen Brute and Pinkie raced back eagerly to the fight—and suddenly the\nface of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and\ntouched his fingers to it, then looked at his hand in horror.\n  \n \n  The Butcher spared a second to repeat his command to the uninjes. But\nalready the battle was going against the larger dogs. The latter had\nthe advantage of weight and could toss the smaller dogs like so many\nfoxes. But their terrible fangs did no damage, and whenever an uninj\nclamped on a throat, that throat was torn out.\n  \n \n  Meanwhile, great bloody stains had appeared on the bodies of all the\nwarriors. They drew back in a knot, looking at each other fearfully.\nThat was when the Butcher got to his feet and strode forward, hand\nclenching the levitator above his head.\n  \n \n  \"Get back where you belong, you big jerks! And drop that lady!\"\n  \n \n  The first warrior pointed toward him and hissed something. Immediately,\na half dozen swords were smiting at the Butcher.\n  \n \n  \"We are working to energize the safeguards,\" the interpreter said in\nmechanical panic. \"Remain patient and in your seats.\"\n  \n \n  The uninjes leaped into the melee, at first tearing more fur than\nflesh. Swords caught them and sent them spinning through the air. They\ncame yapping back for more. Brute fixed on the first warrior's ankle.\nHe dropped the woman, stamped unavailingly on the uninj, and let out a\nscreech.\n  \n \n  Swords were still rebounding from the invisible shield under which the\nButcher crouched, making terrible faces at his attackers. They drew\nback, looked again at their bloodstains, goggled at the demon dogs.\nAt their leader's screech, they broke and plunged back into the Time\nBubble, their leader stumbling limpingly after them. There they wasted\nno time on their own ragged sorcerer. Their swords rose and fell, and\nno repulsor field stayed them.\n  \n \n  \"Brute, come back!\" the Butcher yelled.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_11]\n\"You're rather young to be here, aren't you?\" the interpreter inquired.\n  \n \n \n \n  The Butcher folded his arms and scowled.\n  \n \n  The interpreter hesitated almost humanly, probably snatching through a\nquarter-million microtapes. \"Well, you wouldn't have got in unless a\nqualified adult had certified you as plus-age. Enjoy yourself.\"\n  \n \n  There was no need for the last injunction. The scene within the bubble\nhad acquired a gripping interest. The shaggy warriors were taking up\ntheir swords, gathering about the hooded sorcerer. The hood fell back,\nrevealing a face with hawklike, disturbing eyes that seemed to be\nlooking straight out of the bubble at the future.\n  \n \n  \"This is getting good,\" the Butcher said, squirming toward the edge of\nhis seat.\n  \n \n  \"Stop being an impulsive mentality,\" Hal warned him a little nervously.\n  \n \n  \"Hah!\"\n  \n \n  The sorcerer emptied the small bag on the fire and a thick cloud of\nsmoke puffed toward the ceiling of the bubble. A clawlike hand waved\nwildly. The sorcerer appeared to be expostulating, commanding. The\nwarriors stared uncomprehendingly, which seemed to exasperate the\nsorcerer.\n  \n \n  \"That's right,\" the Butcher approved loudly. \"Sock it to 'em!\"\n  \n \n  \"Butcher!\" Hal admonished.\n  \n \n  Suddenly the bubble grew very bright, as if the Sun had just shone\nforth in the ancient world, though the rain still dripped down.\n  \n \n  \"A viewing anomaly has occurred,\" the interpreter announced. \"It may be\nnecessary to collapse the Time Bubble for a short period.\"\n  \n \n  In a frenzy, his ragged robes twisting like smoke, the sorcerer rushed\nat one of the warriors, pushing him backward so that in a moment he\nmust cross-section.\n  \n \n  \"Attaboy!\" the Butcher encouraged.\n  \n \n  Then the warrior was standing outside the bubble, blinking toward the\nshadows, rain dripping from his beard and furs.\n  \n \n  \"Oh,\n   \n   boy\n   \n  !\" the Butcher cheered in ecstasy.\n  \n \n  \"Butcher, you've done it!\" Hal said, aghast.\n  \n \n  \"I sure did,\" the Butcher agreed blandly, \"but that old guy in the\nbubble helped me. Must take two to work it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep your seats!\" the interpreter said loudly. \"We are energizing the\nsafeguards!\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_8]\nSometimes the men seemed to speak together, or one would rise to peer\ndown the misty forest vistas, but mostly they were motionless. Only\nthe hooded figure, which they seemed to regard with a mingled wonder\nand fear, swayed incessantly to the rhythm of some unheard chant.\n  \n \n  \"The Time Bubble has been brought to rest in one of the barbaric\ncultures of the Dawn Era,\" a soft voice explained, so casually that\nJoggy looked around for the speaker, until Hal nudged him sharply,\nwhispering with barely perceptible embarrassment: \"Don't do that,\nJoggy. It's just the electronic interpreter. It senses our development\nand hears our questions and then it automats background and answers.\nBut it's no more alive than an adolescer or a kinderobot. Got a billion\nmicrotapes, though.\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter continued: \"The skin-clad men we are viewing in Time\nin the Round seem to be a group of warriors of the sort who lived\nby pillage and rapine. The hooded figure is a most unusual find. We\nbelieve it to be that of a sorcerer who pretended to control the forces\nof nature and see into the future.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy whispered: \"How is it that we can't see the audience through the\nother side of the bubble? We can see through this side, all right.\"\n  \n \n  \"The bubble only shines light out,\" Hal told him hurriedly, to show he\nknew some things as well as the interpreter. \"Nothing, not even light,\ncan get into the bubble from outside. The audience on the other side of\nthe bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other\nway—for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the\nway. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.\"\n  \n \n  Joggy nodded. \"You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's\na kind of hole through time?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right.\" Hal cleared his throat and recited: \"The bubble is the\nlocus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two\npoints in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely\nopen, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped—and so would\nan atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain\nthe bubble, let alone maneuver it.\"\n  \n \n  \"I see, I guess,\" Joggy whispered. \"But if the hole works for light,\nwhy can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why—er—you see, Joggy—\"\n  \n \n  The interpreter took over. \"The holes are one-way for light, but no-way\nfor matter. If one of the individuals inside the bubble walked toward\nyou, he would cross-section and disappear. But to the audience on the\nopposite side of the bubble, it would be obvious that he had walked\naway along the vista down which they are peering.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_9]\nAs if to provide an example, a figure suddenly materialized on\ntheir side of the bubble. The wolflike dogs bared their fangs. For\nan instant, there was only an eerie, distorted, rapidly growing\nsilhouette, changing from blood-red to black as the boundary of the\nbubble cross-sectioned the intruding figure. Then they recognized the\nback of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on\nthe other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some\ntime.\n  \n \n  He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.\n  \n \n  \"More atavistic cubs, big and little! Hold still, Cynthia,\" a new voice\ncut in.\n  \n \n  Hal turned and saw that two cold-eyed girls had been ushered into the\ncubicle. One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand while\nmopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other.\n  \n \n  Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: \"Butch!\"\n  \n \n  But Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble.\n  \n \n  \"Then how is it, Hal,\" he asked, \"that light comes out of the bubble,\nif the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks toward\nus, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the light\ncoming our way disappear, too?\"\n  \n \n  \"Well—you see, Joggy, it isn't real light. It's—\"\n  \n \n  Once more the interpreter helped him out.\n  \n \n  \"The light that comes from the bubble is an isotope. Like atoms of\none element, photons of a single frequency also have isotopes. It's\nmore than a matter of polarization. One of these isotopes of light\ntends to leak futureward through holes in space-time. Most of the\nlight goes down the vistas visible to the other side of the audience.\nBut one isotope is diverted through the walls of the bubble into the\nTime Theater. Perhaps, because of the intense darkness of the theater,\nyou haven't realized how dimly lit the scene is. That's because we're\ngetting only a single isotope of the original light. Incidentally, no\nisotopes have been discovered that leak pastward, though attempts are\nbeing made to synthesize them.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, explanations!\" murmured one of the newly arrived girls. \"The cubs\nare always angling for them. Apple-polishers!\"\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   I\n   \n  like this show,\" a familiar voice announced serenely. \"They cut\nanybody yet with those choppers?\"\n  \n \n  Hal looked down beside him. \"Butch! How did you manage to get in?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't see any blood. Where's the bodies?\"\n  \n \n  \"But how\n   \n   did\n   \n  you get in—Butcher?\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_5]\nIt was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking\nand quite useless against the wind. True, by rocking the repulsor\nhemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would\nbe nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the\nsimplest way to make progress.\n  \n \n  The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were\namong the most prized of toys.\n  \n \n  \"There's the Theater,\" Joggy announced.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   know\n   \n  ,\" the Butcher said irritably.\n  \n \n  But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp\nto the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god\nrealized in unearthly substance. It imparted the aura of demigods to\nthe adults drifting up and down the ramp.\n  \n \n  \"My father remembers when there wasn't a Time Theater,\" Hal said softly\nas he scanned the facade's glowing charts and maps. \"Say, they're\nviewing Earth, somewhere in Scandinavia around zero in the B.C.-A.D.\ntime scale. It should be interesting.\"\n  \n \n  \"Will it be about Napoleon?\" the Butcher asked eagerly. \"Or Hitler?\" A\nred-headed adult heard and smiled and paused to watch. A lock of hair\nhad fallen down the middle of the Butcher's forehead, and as he sat\nJoggy like a charger, he did bear a faint resemblance to one of the\ngrim little egomaniacs of the Dawn Era.\n  \n \n  \"Wrong millennium,\" Hal said.\n  \n \n  \"Tamerlane then?\" the Butcher pressed. \"He killed cities and piled the\nskulls. Blood-bath stuff. Oh, yes, and Tamerlane was a Scand of the\nNavies.\"\n  \n \n  Hal looked puzzled and then quickly erased the expression. \"Well, even\nif it is about Tamerlane, you can't see it. How about it, Joggy?\"\n  \n \n  \"They won't let me in, either.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, they will. You're five years old now.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I don't feel any older,\" Joggy replied doubtfully.\n  \n \n  \"The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the\ndifference.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their\nfeet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened\nhis mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in\ntight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier—like Stalin, maybe, he\nthought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which\ndrank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher\nlimped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his\nbattle injury.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_1]\nTIME IN THE ROUND\n  \n \n  By FRITZ LEIBER\n  \n \n  Illustrated by DILLON\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Galaxy Science Fiction May 1957.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n \n   Poor Butcher suffered more than any dictator\n    \n   in history: everybody gave in to him because\n    \n   he was so puny and they were so impregnable!\n   \n \n \n \n  From the other end of the Avenue of Wisdom that led across the Peace\nPark, a gray, hairless, heavily built dog was barking soundlessly at\nthe towering crystal glory of the Time Theater. For a moment, the\neffect was almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of\ncivilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy caught up\nwith the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the\nscene was normal again.\n  \n \n  The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied\nthe dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and\npoked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his\ngrip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog's tail thumped the cushiony\npavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip\nand suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff\ntube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an\nupside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long\nblack tongue lolled.\n  \n \n  The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube\nwith a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone\ncalled: \"Hi, Butch! Sic 'em, Darter, sic 'em!\"\n  \n \n  A larger small boy and a somewhat older one were approaching across the\nluxurious, neatly cropped grass, preceded by a hurtling shape that,\nexcept for a black hide, was a replica of Butch's gray dog.\n  \n \n  Butch shrugged his shoulders resignedly and said in a bored voice:\n\"Kill 'em, Brute.\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_14]\nThe gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered\nout of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light\nintensity and then winked out.\n  \n \n  For once in their very mature lives, all of the adults in the\nauditorium began to jabber at each other simultaneously.\n  \n \n  \"We are sorry, but the anomaly has made it necessary to collapse the\nTime Bubble,\" the interpreter said. \"There will be no viewing until\nfurther announcement. Thank you for your patience.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his\narms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The\nButcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.\n  \n \n  \"Cubs!\" came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. \"Always\nplaying hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come\nfrom those dirty past men.\"\n  \n \n  Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening\nto them or to the older voices clamoring about \"revised theories of\nreality\" and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute\nlicked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically\non his mouth.\n  \n \n  He smiled dreamily and stroked Brute's muzzle and murmured softly: \"We\ncame, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?\"\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_10]\nThe Butcher replied airily: \"A red-headed man talked to me and said it\ncertainly was sad for a future dictator not to be able to enjoy scenes\nof carnage in his youth, so I told him I'd been inside the Time Theater\nand just come out to get a drink of water and go to the eliminator, but\nthen my sprained ankle had got worse—I kind of tried to get up and\nfell down again—so he picked me up and carried me right through the\nusher.\"\n  \n \n  \"Butcher, that wasn't honest,\" Hal said a little worriedly. \"You\ntricked him into thinking you were older and his brain waves blanketed\nyours, going through the usher. I really\n   \n   have\n   \n  heard it's dangerous\nfor you under-fives to be in here.\"\n  \n \n  \"The way those cubs beg for babying and get it!\" one of the girls\ncommented. \"Talk about sex favoritism!\" She and her companion withdrew\nto the far end of the cubicle.\n  \n \n  The Butcher grinned at them briefly and concentrated his attention on\nthe scene in the Time Bubble.\n  \n \n  \"Those big dogs—\" he began suddenly. \"Brute must have smelled 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be silly,\" Hal said. \"Smells can't come out of the Time Bubble.\nSmells haven't any isotopes and—\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted. \"I bet somebody'll figure out\nsomeday how to use the bubble for time traveling.\"\n  \n \n  \"You can't travel in a point of view,\" Hal contradicted, \"and that's\nall the bubble is. Besides, some scientists think the bubble isn't real\nat all, but a—uh—\"\n  \n \n  \"I believe,\" the interpreter cut in smoothly, \"that you're thinking\nof the theory that the Time Bubble operates by hypermemory. Some\nscientists would have us believe that all memory is time traveling and\nthat the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but\never-present eternity. Some of them go so far as to state that it is\nonly a mental inability that prevents the Time Bubble from being used\nfor time traveling—just as it may be a similar disability that keeps\na robot with the same or even more scopeful memories from being a real\nman or animal.\n  \n \n  \"It is because of this minority theory that under-age individuals and\nother beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time\nTheater. But do not be alarmed. Even if the minority theory should\nprove true—and no evidence for it has ever appeared—there are\nautomatically operating safeguards to protect the audience from any\nharmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible,\nremember) in either direction.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sissies!\" was the Butcher's comment.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_12]\nThe warriors inside the bubble stared in stupid astonishment after the\none who had disappeared from their view. The sorcerer leaped about,\npushing them in his direction.\n  \n \n  Abrupt light flooded the Time Theater. The warriors who had emerged\nfrom the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth.\n  \n \n  \"The safeguards are now energized,\" the interpreter said.\n  \n \n  A woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row\nof the audience.\n  \n \n  The first warrior looked her up and down, took one hesitant step\nforward, then another, then suddenly grabbed her and flung her over his\nleft shoulder, looking around menacingly and swinging his sword in his\nright hand.\n  \n \n  \"I repeat, the safeguards have been fully energized! Keep your seats!\"\nthe interpreter enjoined.\n  \n \n  In the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the\nButcher yelled a \"Hey!\" of disapproval, snatched up something from the\nfloor and darted out through the sphincter.\n  \n \n  Here and there in the audience, other adults stood up. The emerged\nwarriors formed a ring of swinging swords and questing eyes. Between\ntheir legs their wolfish dogs, emerged with them, crouched and snarled.\nThen the warriors began to fan out.\n  \n \n  \"There has been an unavoidable delay in energizing the safeguards,\" the\ninterpreter said. \"Please be patient.\"\n  \n \n  At that moment, the Butcher entered the main auditorium, brandishing a\nlevitator above his head and striding purposefully down the aisle. At\nhis heels, five stocky forms trotted. In a definitely pre-civilization\nvoice, or at least with pre-civilization volume, he bellowed: \"Hey,\nyou! You quit that!\"\n  \n \n  The first warrior looked toward him, gave his left shoulder a shake to\nquiet his wriggling captive, gave his right shoulder one to supple his\nsword arm, and waited until the dwarfish challenger came into range.\nThen his sword swished down in a flashing arc.\n  \n \n  Next moment, the Butcher was on his knees and the warrior was staring\nat him open-mouthed. The sword had rebounded from something invisible\nan arm's length above the gnomelike creature's head. The warrior backed\na step.\n  \n \n \n \n  The Butcher stayed down, crouching half behind an aisle seat and\ndigging for something in his pocket. But he didn't stay quiet. \"Sic\n'em, Brute!\" he shrilled. \"Sic 'em, Darter! Sic 'em, Pinkie and Whitie\nand Blue!\" Then he stopped shouting and raised his hand to his mouth.\n\n[Chapter: TIME_IN_THE_ROUND_3]\nHe kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" Joggy said, \"you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would\nyou?\"\n  \n \n  \"How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?\" the Butcher demanded\nscathingly. \"An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits\nand a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.\" He looked at Brute with\nguarded wistfulness.\n  \n \n  \"I don't know about that,\" Hal put in. \"I've heard an uninj is\nprogrammed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically\nhas racial memory.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean if you\n   \n   could\n   \n  hurt an uninj,\" Joggy amended.\n  \n \n  \"Well, maybe I wouldn't,\" the Butcher admitted grudgingly. \"But shut\nup—I want to think.\"\n  \n \n  \"About what?\" Hal asked with saintly reasonableness.\n  \n \n  The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. \"When I'm World Director,\" he\nsaid slowly, \"I'm going to have warfare again.\"\n  \n \n  \"You think so now,\" Hal told him. \"We all do at your age.\"\n  \n \n  \"We do not,\" the Butcher retorted. \"I bet\n   \n   you\n   \n  didn't.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,\" the older boy confessed readily. \"All\nnewborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless.\nThey have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death\ngames and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult\nconditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why,\nlong after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people\nkept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them\ndifferently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's\ngreatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all\nviolent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.\"\n  \n \n  \"I will not!\" the Butcher countered hotly. \"I'm not going to be a\nsissy.\" Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. \"And what if we\nwere attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Space Fleet would take care of them,\" Hal replied calmly. \"That's\nwhat it's for. Adults aren't conditioned to reject violent solutions to\nproblems where non-human enemies are concerned. Look at what we did to\nviruses.\"\n  \n \n  \"But what if somebody got at us through the Time Bubble?\"\n  \n \n  \"They can't. It's impossible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, but suppose they did all the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"You've never been inside the Time Theater—you're not old enough\nyet—so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons\nwhy it's impossible,\" Hal replied with friendly factuality. \"The Time\nBubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into\nthe past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't\nchange the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't care,\" the Butcher asserted obstinately. \"I'm still going to\nhave warfare when I'm World Director.\"\n  \n \n  \"They'll condition you out of the idea,\" Hal assured him.\n  \n \n  \"They will not. I won't let 'em.\"\n  \n \n  \"It doesn't matter what you think now,\" Hal said with finality. \"You'll\nhave an altogether different opinion when you're six.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, what if I will?\" the Butcher snapped back. \"You don't have to\nkeep\n   \n   telling\n   \n  me about it, do you?\"\n\n[Chapter: AMBITION_12]\nThe cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders\nand fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes\nand looked at her. \"I just don't understand,\" he said. \"It seemed\nobvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd\ndo it.\"\n  \n \n  Her pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he\nwas facing her. \"I've got to understand. I've got to know\n   \n   why\n   \n  . What\nhappened? Why don't men want the planets any more?\"\n  \n \n  \"Honestly,\" she said, \"I did not know they ever had.\" She hesitated.\n\"Maybe you are asking the wrong question.\"\n  \n \n  He furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her.\n  \n \n  \"I mean,\" she explained, \"maybe you should ask why people in the 20th\nCentury\n   \n   did\n   \n  want to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit.\"\n  \n \n  Maitland felt his face become hot. \"Men can go anywhere, if they want\nto bad enough.\"\n  \n \n  \"But\n   \n   why\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  Despite his sudden irrational anger toward her, Maitland tried to stick\nto logic. \"Living space, for one thing. The only permanent solution to\nthe population problem....\"\n  \n \n  \"We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we realized that\nthe key to social stability is a limited population. Our economic\nsystem was built to take care of three hundred million people, and we\nhave held the number at that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Birth control,\" Maitland scoffed. \"How do you make it work—secret\npolice?\"\n  \n \n  \"No. Education. Each of us has the right to two children, and we\ncherish that right so much that we make every effort to see that those\ntwo are the best children we could possibly produce....\"\n  \n \n  She broke off, looking a little self-conscious. \"You understand, what\nI have been saying applies to\n   \n   most\n   \n  of the world. In some places like\nAresund, things are different. Backward. I still do not feel that I\nbelong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Even,\" he said, \"granting that you have solved the population problem,\nthere's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must\nbe men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in\nyour blood, the idea of going to Mars—just to go there and see what's\nthere and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested\nin finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of\nVenus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance\nof only two hundred thousand miles?\" His hands were trembling as he\nstopped.\n  \n \n  She shrugged her shapely shoulders. \"Go into the past—yes! But go out\nthere? I still cannot see why.\"\n  \n \n  \"Has the spirit of adventure\n   \n   evaporated\n   \n  from the human race, or\n   \n   what\n   \n  ?\"\n  \n \n  She smiled. \"In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. Swarts\nkilled the beast when he was a young man. He used a spear. And time\ntraveling is the greatest adventure there is. At least, that is the\nway I feel. Listen, Bob.\" She laid a hand on his arm. \"You grew up in\nthe Age of Technology. Everybody was terribly excited about what could\nbe done with machines—machines to blow up a city all at once, or fly\naround the world, or take a man to Mars. We have had our fill of—what\nis the word?—gadgets. Our machines serve us, and so long as they\nfunction right, we are satisfied to forget about them.\n  \n \n  \"Because this is the Age of\n   \n   Man\n   \n  . We are terribly interested in what\ncan be done with people. Our scientists, like Swarts, are studying\nhuman rather than nuclear reactions.

His present position was like that of an\nearnest 12th Century crusader, deposited by some freak of nature into\nthe year 1950, trying to find a way of reanimating the anti-Mohammedan\nmovement. What chance would he have? The unfortunate knight would argue\nin vain that the atomic bomb offered a means of finally destroying the\ninfidel....\n  \n \n  Maitland looked up at the girl, who was regarding him silently with\ntroubled eyes. \"I think I'd like to be alone for a while,\" he said.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the story, \"pre-civilization\" refers to a time and a mindset characterized by genuine violence, the ability to cause and receive physical harm, and a general lack of the emotional conditioning that defines the current society.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  The term is first introduced to describe the main character, Butch, precisely when he is attempting to inflict pain on his uninjurable dog. This immediately associates \"pre-civilization\" with the impulse to cause harm, even if it's futile in his current environment.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied the dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and poked.\n    ##end_quote##\n\n2.  The children's conversation further defines this concept. Joggy directly equates the past, which Butch idealizes, with a time of real physical violence and injury, contrasting it with their safe, \"pretend\" world. This historical era of bloodshed is what they consider pre-civilization.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    All right, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people were hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?\n    ##end_quote##\n\n3.  Hal's explanation solidifies the definition by contrasting the past with their present. He describes their current \"civilization\" as one where people are conditioned from a young age to be peaceful. Therefore, \"pre-civilization\" is the state before this conditioning, a time when humanity had not yet learned to suppress violent impulses and solve problems without conflict.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    Man's greatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all violent solutions to problems.\n    ##end_quote##\n\n##Answer: In the context of the story, \"pre-civilization\" describes a historical period and a personal mindset"}], "metadata": {"id": "279", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["The term pre-civilization points to anything that has a sense of violence or chaos in the lives of adults. For instance, raised voices and people talking over each other is considered pre-civilization, but so are violent wars. The society is built to get rid of these tendencies in children and recondition them as adults to be calm and peaceful members of society. When the Butcher is referred to as looking pre-civilization at the beginning of the story, it is because he seems to be up to something he isn't supposed to do, as he is potentially hurting or controlling Brute in some way with the use of a metal tube. ", "In “Time in the Round,” the society is structured around perfection. Small children are given breakables, and those items are the only things that are physically capable of being broken. There are dirt-pens for kids to play in, and besides those areas, children are incapable of becoming dirty. The dirt-pens are only available to children aged 2 and younger. The society’s dogs, uninjes, are programmed not to bite or hurt the people, even when they are hit or stabbed themselves. They do not react like normal canines. \n\nYoung children are considered to be self-centered and ruthless, and they are provided with death games and fear houses to get out their emotions and prepare to be conditioned as adults. When children turn six years old, they feel differently than they did before. They are ready to enter the Time Theater and view the Time Bubble. They are taught about pre-civilization and the important differences between their own society and the past. They learn how to reject violent solutions to problems and live in peace. Even yelling is considered a pre-civilization act. When Butch enters the Time Theater and tries to get the Scandinavian warrior’s attention, he is using someithing called a “pre-civilization voice”. The Time Bubble is a tool that society uses to remind its current citizens what humans used to act barbarically, and that is not longer appropriate. \n", "Pre-civilization seems to refer to the society that we know, and any society that predates the decision to make violence impossible and to control all aspects of societal behavior. Hal describes the process of conditioning humanity to reject violence in all forms, and pre-civilization points to a time before that process was undertaken. For example, Butch is referred to as “pre-civilization” when he continually abuses an uninj at the beginning of the story, because he is behaving in a violent way. He is described this way again at the end of the story when he is shouting battle orders. \n", "Pre-civilization primarily refers to the time before the post-violent society where the central action of the story takes place. They are able to view this era by using the time-hole technology of the bubble on display at the Time Theater in the Peace Park at the end of the Avenue of Wisdom. \"Pre-civilization\" is characterized by famous historical figures such as Hitler, Stalin, and Tamerlane--individuals that the Butcher idealizes for their use of violence in resolving conflict. The climax of the story revolves around a viewing of Scandinavian men of the Dawn Era gone wrong when the simultaneous workings of a sorcerer and the Butcher's impulsive mind allow the Scandinavian men to pass through the bubble into the Time Theater. The ensuing battle highlights the barbarism of the Dawn Era--they use swords and real dogs in battle; it also demonstrates the Butcher's ability to weaponize technology meant to oppose violence as a way to protect this new society."]}}
