Aphrodite\n   \n  were in conference with\nthe Captain when Cob and the girl at his side reached the flying\nbridge. She was tall and dark-haired with regular features and pale\nblue eyes. She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the\nshoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the\nobvious trimness of her figure.\n  \n \n  Strike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others.\n  \n \n  \"... and that's about the story. We are to jet within 28,000,000 miles\nof Sol. Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. With Mars in opposition,\nwe have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant. But I'm\ncertain this old boiler can take it. I understand the old boy who\ndesigned her wasn't as incompetent as they say. But Space Regs are\nspecific about mail runs. This is important to you, Evans. Your\nastrogation has to be accurate to within twenty-five miles plus or\nminus the shortest route. And there'll be no breaking orbit. Now be\ncertain that the refrigeration units are checked, Mister Wilkins,\nespecially in the hydroponic cells. Pure air is going to be important.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's about all there is to tell you. As soon as our rather\nleisurely E/O gets here, we can jet with Aunt Nelly's postcard.\" He\nnodded. \"That's the story. Lift ship in....\" He glanced at his wrist\nchronograph, \"... in an hour and five.\"\n  \n \n  The officers filed out and Cob Whitley stuck his head into the room.\n\"Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"Come in, Cob.\" Strike's dark brows knit at the sight of the uniformed\ngirl in the doorway.\n  \n \n  Cob's face was sober, but hidden amusement was kindling behind his\neyes. \"Captain, may I present Lieutenant Hendricks? Lieutenant\n   \n   I-vy\n   \n  Hendricks?\"\n  \n \n  Strike looked blankly at the girl.\n  \n \n  \"Our new E/O, Captain,\" prompted Whitley.\n  \n \n  \"Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks,\" was all the Captain could find\nto say.\n  \n \n  The girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. \"Thank you, Captain.\" Her\nvoice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. \"If I may have your\npermission to inspect the drives, Captain, I\n   \n   may\n   \n  be able to\nconvince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seem\nto think ... a senile incompetent.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was perplexed, and he showed it. \"Why, certainly ... uh ...\nMiss ... but why should you be so....\"\n  \n \n  The girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, \"Harlan\nHendricks, Captain, is my father.\"\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_2]\nAnd she was not an inspiring sight. The fantastically misnamed\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten\nyears back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation\nIncident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a\nsurge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the\nplanner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its\nformative stage, and at the time of the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  launching the\nsurge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.\n  \n \n  Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit\nfor her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed\nof hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The\n   \n   Artemis\n   \n  , the\n   \n   Andromeda\n   \n  , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The\nthree vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid\nhad set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.\n  \n \n  All three were miserable failures.\n  \n \n  The eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuit\ntoo appealing to their hot little hands. They used it ... in some way,\nwrongly.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Artemis\n   \n  exploded. The\n   \n   Andromeda\n   \n  vanished in the general\ndirection of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of a\nruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions.\nAnd the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  starboard tubes blew, causing her to spend her\nstore of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under\n20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were a\ntangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  was refitted for space. And because it was an integral\npart of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. She became\na workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. She\ncarried personnel.... She trucked ores. She ferried skeeterboats and\ntanked rocket fuel. Now, she would carry the mail. She would lift from\nVenusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation.\nRegulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet\nrequired it. And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to see\nto it that she did....\n  \n \n  The Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys saluted\nsmartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve.\n  \n \n  Strike felt vaguely uncomfortable. He knew, of course, that at least a\nthird of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner Planet\nFleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a ship\nof his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere.\n  \n \n  Cob sensed his discomfort. \"That was Celia Graham, Strike. Ensign.\nRadar Officer. She's good, too.\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Don't like women in space. They make me\nuncomfortable.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged. \"Celia's the only officer. But about a quarter of our\nratings are women.\" He grinned maliciously. \"Equal rights, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"No doubt,\" commented the other sourly. \"Is that why they named\nthis ... ship 'Aphrodite'?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent.\n  \n \n  Strike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridge\nbulkhead. Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungle\nof chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into an\nacceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit\nrheostat.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?\" commented Cob.\n  \n \n  Strykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  flying-bridge. \"But she's home to us, anyway.\"\n  \n \n  The thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship,\nhugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. Strike\nreached for the squawk-box control.\n  \n \n  \"Now hear this. All officer personnel will assemble in the flying\nbridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. Officer of the Deck will\nrecall any enlisted personnel now on liberty....\"\n  \n \n  Whitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner.\n\"Orders, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here.\nThey're sending someone down from the\n   \n   Antigone\n   \n  , and I expect him by\n600 hours. In the meantime you'll take over his part of the work. See\nto it that we are fueled and ready to lift ship by 602. Base will start\nloading the mail at 599:30. That's about all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\" Whitley saluted and turned to go. At the bulkhead, he\npaused. \"Captain,\" he asked, \"Who is the new E/O to be?\"\n  \n \n  Strike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. \"A Lieutenant\nHendricks, I. V. Hendricks, is what the orders say.\"\n  \n \n  Cob thought hard for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. \"I. V.\nHendricks.\" He shook his head. \"Don't know him.\"\n\n[Chapter: DOUBLE_TROUBLE_2]\nWhen Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,\nvisiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she\nwas crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,\nhad always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've\nmissed something. She's the author of\n   \n   Lady of the Green Flames\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Runaway Planet\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast\n   \n  , and\nother works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,\nhowever, they have one redeeming feature—authenticity of background.\nGrannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she\nlaid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a\ntransportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from\nvisiting her \"stage\" in person.\n  \n \n  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another\nnovel in the state of embryo.\n  \n \n  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie\nhad met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed\nher wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated\nto do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.\n  \n \n  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the\noffices of\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  . And then I was shaking hands with\nAntlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.\n  \n \n  \"Glad to meet you,\" he said cordially. \"I've just been trying to\npersuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the Baldric?\" I had asked.\n  \n \n  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.\n  \n \n  \"Will you believe me, sir,\" he said, \"when I tell you I've been out\nhere on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?\"\n  \n \n  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.\n  \n \n  \"However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities\nhere at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.\nIt's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm\nnot up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red\nplanet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.\nThe Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'\ntransmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations\nper second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches\nmiddle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.\nThen it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding\napparatus, and the rush was on.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean?\"\n  \n \n  Park leaned back. \"The rush to find more of the ore,\" he explained.\n\"But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.\n  \n \n  \"There are two companies here,\" he continued, \"\n   \n   Interstellar Voice\n   \n  and\n   \n   Larynx Incorporated\n   \n  . Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.\nHowever, the point is, between the properties of these two companies\nstretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.\n  \n \n  \"There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees\nand a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has\ncrossed the Baldric without trouble.\"\n  \n \n  \"What sort of trouble?\" Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers\nPark stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, \"Fiddlesticks, I never\nsaw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.\"\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_1]\nJinx Ship To The Rescue\n  \n \n  By ALFRED COPPEL, JR.\n  \n \n  Stand by for\n   \n   T.R.S. Aphrodite\n   \n  , butt of the Space\n   \n  Navy. She's got something terrific in her guts and only\n   \n  her ice-cold lady engineer can coax it out of her!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1948.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III of the\nTellurian Wing, Combined Solarian Navies, stood ankle deep in the\nviscous mud of Venusport Base and surveyed his new command with a\njaundiced eye. The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship. Visibility was\ndropping fast, and soon porto-sonar sets would have to be used to find\nthe way about the surface Base. It was an ordinary day on Venus.\n  \n \n  Strike cursed Space Admiral Gorman and all his ancestors with a wealth\nof feeling. Then he motioned wearily to his companion, and together\nthey sloshed through the mud toward the ancient monitor.\n  \n \n  The scaly bulk of the Tellurian Rocket Ship\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  loomed\nunhappily into the thick air above the two men as they reached the\nventral valve. Strike raised reluctant eyes to the sloping flank of the\nfat spaceship.\n  \n \n  \"It looks,\" he commented bitterly, \"like a pregnant carp.\"\n  \n \n  Senior Lieutenant Coburn Whitley—\"Cob\" to his friends—nodded in\nagreement. \"That's our Lover-Girl ... old Aphrodisiac herself. The ship\nwith the poison personality.\" Cob was the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  Executive,\nand he had been with her a full year ... which was a record for Execs\non the\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  . She generally sent them Earthside with nervous\nbreakdowns in half that time.\n  \n \n  \"Tell me, Captain,\" continued Cob curiously, \"how does it happen\nthat you of all people happened to draw this tub for a command? I\nthought....\"\n  \n \n  \"You know Gorman?\" queried Strykalski.\n  \n \n  Cob nodded. \"Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. Old Brass-bottom Gorman?\"\n  \n \n  \"The same.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Cob ran a hand over his chin speculatively, \"I know Gorman's\na prize stinker ... but you were in command of the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . And,\nafter all, you come from an old service family and all that. How come\nthis?\" He indicated the monitor expressively.\n  \n \n  Strike sighed. \"Well, now, Cob, I'll tell you. You'll be spacing with\nme and I guess you've a right to know the worst ... not that you\nwouldn't find it out anyway. I come from a long line of very sharp\noperators. Seven generations of officers and gentlemen. Lousy with\ntradition.\n  \n \n  \"The first David Farragut Strykalski, son of a sea-loving Polish\nimmigrant, emerged from World War II a four-striper and Congressional\nMedal winner. Then came David Farragut Strykalski, Jr., and, in the\nabortive Atomic War that terrified the world in 1961, he won a United\nNations Peace Citation. And then came David Farragut Strykalski III ...\nme.\n  \n \n  \"From such humble beginnings do great traditions grow. But something\nhappened when I came into the picture. I don't fit with the rest of\nthem. Call it luck or temperament or what have you.\n  \n \n  \"In the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the\nwrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too\nmuch on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  because I left my station where I was supposed to be running\nsection-lines to take on a bunch of colonists I thought were in\ndanger....\"\n  \n \n  \"The Procyon A people?\" asked Cob.\n  \n \n  \"So you've heard about it.\" Strike shook his head sadly. \"My tactical\nastrophysicist warned me that Procyon A might go nova. I left my\nroutine post and loaded up on colonists.\" He shrugged. \"Wrong guess. No\nnova. I made an ass of myself and lost the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . Gorman gave it\nto his former aide. I got this.\"\n  \n \n  Cob coughed slightly. \"I heard something about Ley City, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Me again. The\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  whole crew ended up in the Luna Base brig.\nWe celebrated a bit too freely.\"\n  \n \n  Cob Whitley looked admiringly at his new Commander. \"That was the night\nafter the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  broke the record for the Centaurus B-Earth run,\nwasn't it? And then wasn't there something about....\"\n  \n \n  \"Canalopolis?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley nodded.\n  \n \n  \"That time I called the Martian Ambassador a spy. It was at a Tellurian\nEmbassy Ball.\"\n  \n \n  \"I begin to see what you mean, Captain.\"\n  \n \n  \"Strike's the name, Cob.\"\n  \n \n  Whitley's smile was expansive. \"Strike, I think you're going to like\nour old tin pot here.\" He patted the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  nether belly\naffectionately. \"She's old ... but she's loose. And we're not likely to\nmeet any Ambassadors or Admirals with her, either.\"\n  \n \n  Strykalski sighed, still thinking of his sleek\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  . \"She'll\ncarry the mail, I suppose. And that's about all that's expected of her.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged philosophically. \"Better than tanking that stinking rocket\nfuel, anyway. Deep space?\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Venus-Mars.\"\n  \n \n  Cob scratched his chin speculatively. \"Perihelion run. Hot work.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was again looking at the spaceship's unprepossessing exterior.\n\"A surge-circuit monitor, so help me.\"\n  \n \n  Cob nodded agreement. \"The last of her class.\"\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_7]\nThe orchestra was subdued, the officer's club softly lighted. Cob\nleaned his elbow on the bar and bent to inspect the blue ribbon of the\nSpatial Cross on Strike's chest. Then he inspected his own and nodded\nwith tipsy satisfaction. He stared out at the Martian night beyond the\nbroad windows and back again at Strike. His frown was puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" said Strike, setting down his glass. \"What's on your mind,\nCob? Something's eating you.\"\n  \n \n  Whitley nodded very slowly. He took a long pull at his highball. \"I\nunderstand that you goofballed your chances of getting the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  back when Gorman spoke his piece to you....\"\n  \n \n  \"All I said to him....\"\n  \n \n  \"I know. I know what you said ... and it won't bear repeating. But\nyou're not fooling me. You've fallen for old Lover-Girl and you don't\nwant to leave her. Ver-ry commendable. Loyal! Stout fellah! But what\nabout Ivy?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ivy?\"\n  \n \n  Cob looked away. \"I thought that you and she ... well, I thought that\nwhen we got back ... well....\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"She's gone to the Bureau of Ships with a\ndesigning job.\"\n  \n \n  Cob waved an expressive arm in the air. \"But dammit, man, I thought....\"\n  \n \n  \"The answer is\n   \n   no\n   \n  . Ivy's a nice girl ... but....\" He paused and\nsighed. \"Since she was promoted to her father's old rank ... well....\"\nHe shrugged. \"Who wants a wife that ranks you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never thought of that,\" mused Cob. For a long while he was silent;\nthen he pulled out an address book and leafed through until he came to\nthe pages marked \"Canalopolis, Mars.\"\n  \n \n  And he was gratified to see that Lieutenant Commander David Farragut\nStrykalski III was doing the same.\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_4]\nA week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.\nJetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  had burned a\nsteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall\nwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected\nrepairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running\nten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation\nOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the\norbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....\n  \n \n  For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike\nand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in\nspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between\nthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\n  \n \n  And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was\ndedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.\nThere's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.\n  \n \n  At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  refrigeration\nunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable\ntemperature. The thermometer stood at 102°F, the very metal of\nthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,\ninsignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and\nspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the\nsodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to\ntheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.\n  \n \n  Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham\ncalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. The\nIFF showed the pips to be the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  . The two\ndreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely\nroutine business. But the thing that made Strike curse under his breath\nwas Celia Graham's notation that the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  carried none other than\nSpace Admiral Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan.\n  \n \n  Strike thought it a pity that old Brass-bottom couldn't fall into\nHell's hottest pit ... and he told Ivy so.\n  \n \n  And she agreed.\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_6]\nLashed together with a length of unbreakable beryllium steel cable,\nthe\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  fell helplessly toward the sun. The\nfrantic flame that lashed out from the\n   \n   Lachesis'\n   \n  tube was fading, her\nfission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms.\nStill she tried. She could not desert her sister ship, nor could she\nsave her. Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 miles\nof the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. The prominences\nthat spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching for\nthe trapped men on board the warships. The atmospheric guiding fins,\nthe gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginning\nto melt under the fierce radiance. Only the huge refrigeration plants\non the vessels made life within them possible. And, even so, men were\ndying.\n  \n \n  Swiftly, the fat, ungainly shape of old Aphrodisiac drew near. In her\nflying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks watched the stricken ships in\nthe darkened viewport.\n  \n \n  The temperature stood at 140° and the air was bitter with the smell\nof hot metal. Ivy's blouse clung to her body, soaked through with\nperspiration. Sweat ran from her hair into her eyes and she gasped\nfor breath in the oven hot compartment. Strike watched her with\napprehension.\n  \n \n  Carefully, Ivy circled the two warships. From the starboard tube on\nthe gun-deck, a homing rocket leapt toward the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  . It plunged\nstraight and true, spilling cable as it flew. It slammed up against\nthe hull, and stuck there, fast to the battleship's flank. Quickly,\na robocrane drew it within the ship and the cable was made secure.\nLike cosmic replicas of the ancient South American \"bolas,\" the three\nspacecraft whirled in space ... and all three began that sunward plunge\ntogether.\n  \n \n \n \n   They were diving into the sun.\n   \n \n \n \n  The heat in the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  bridge was unbearable. The thermometer\nshowed 145° and it seemed to Strike that Hell must be cool by\ncomparison.\n  \n \n  Ivy fought her reeling senses and the bucking ship as the slack came\nout of the cable. Blackness was flickering at the edges of her field\nof vision. She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuit\nrheostat. Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. Conscious,\nbut too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrument\npanel.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ivy!\n   \n  \" Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I ... can't make it ... Strike. You'll ... have to run ... the\nshow ... after ... all.\"\n  \n \n  Strike laid her gently in an acceleration chair and turned toward the\ncontrol panel. His head was throbbing painfully as he broke the seal on\nthe surge-circuit.\n  \n \n  Slowly he turned the rheostat. Relays chattered. From deep within\nold Lover-Girl's vitals came a low whine. He fed more power into the\ncircuit. Cadmium rods slipped into lead sheaths decks below in the\ntube-rooms. The whining rose in pitch. The spinning of the ships in\nspace slowed. Stopped. With painful deliberation, they swung into line.\n  \n \n  More power. The whine changed to a shriek. A banshee wail.\n  \n \n  Cob's voice came through the squawk-box, soberly. \"Strike, Celia's\nfainted down here. We can't take much more of this heat.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're trying, Cob!\" shouted Strike over the whine of the circuit. The\ngauges showed the accumulators full. \"\n   \n   Now!\n   \n  \" He spun the rheostat to\nthe stops, and black space burst over his brain....\n  \n \n  The last thing he remembered was a voice. It sounded like Bayne's. And\nit was shouting. \"We're moving 'em! We're pulling away! We're....\" And\nthat was all.\n  \n \n  The space-tug\n   \n   Scylla\n   \n  found them.\n  \n \n  The three ships ...\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  ,\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  , and old Aphrodisiac ...\nlashed together and drifting in space. Every man and woman aboard out\ncold from the acceleration, and\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  tanks bone dry.

She is the daughter of Harlan Hendricks, the man who designed the ship and its infamous, and previously disastrous, surge-circuit drive. Her primary motivation is to vindicate her father's reputation, which was ruined after the drive failed on its first three ships. She is immediately defensive of her father's work when she overhears Captain Strykalski's disparaging remarks.\n\n##begin_quote##\nThe girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, \"Harlan Hendricks, Captain, is my father.\"\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 2: Proving Her Worth and Planning the Rescue**\nAboard the *Aphrodite*, Ivy proves to be a highly competent engineer and pilot, earning the reluctant admiration of Captain Strykalski. They bond over a shared dislike for Admiral Gorman, whom Ivy blames for ruining her father's career. When Gorman's ship, the *Atropos*, is falling into the sun, Ivy sees an opportunity to prove the surge-circuit's true potential. She passionately argues that she has the training to operate it correctly and can save the crippled dreadnaughts.\n\n##begin_quote##\n\"But we can save those ships! We can, I know we can! My father designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots off Callisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed specially trained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained!\"\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 3: The Rescue Attempt and its Aftermath**\nCaptain Strykalski trusts Ivy and allows her to pilot the rescue mission. As the *Aphrodite* gets dangerously close to the sun, the intense heat becomes unbearable. Ivy successfully pilots the ship and attaches a cable to the distressed vessels, but she collapses from heat exhaustion before she can activate the surge-circuit. Strykalski takes over, engages the drive, and successfully pulls the ships to safety.\n\n**Step 4: Vindicating Her Father and Her Final Status**\nFollowing the successful rescue, which proved her father's design was viable, Ivy's skills are recognized. She is promoted to her father's old rank and accepts a prestigious position at the Bureau of Ships. Her professional goal is achieved, and her father's legacy is restored. The potential romance between her and Strykalski is left unresolved, partly due to her new, higher rank.\n\n##begin_quote##\n\"She's gone to the Bureau of Ships with a designing job.\"\n\n##Answer: "}], "metadata": {"id": "511", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 2, "reference_answers": ["Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks is the daughter of Harlan Hendricks, a formerly respected engineer. He created the surge-circuit, an innovation in interstellar astrogation, and he was awarded a Legion of Merit. He designed three famous ships: the Artemis, the Andromeda, and the Aphrodite, the prototype. Despite being hailed as the latest and greatest in technology, all three ships either exploded or failed. \nAccording to Lieutenant Ivy Hendricks, their failures were due to the lack of education on board. She claimed that her father asked for the crew members to be trained in surge-circuit technology, so they could use it properly and correctly. That wish was not granted and after all three ships failed, his reputation and career were doomed. Admiral Gorman pulled the plug on his career and therefore became the target of all Lieutenant Hendricks’ hate. \nWith a bone to pick, Lieutenant Hendricks, a knowledgeable engineer herself, comes aboard the Aphrodite to serve as her engineer and occasional pilot. She wants to prove to the world that her father’s creation was genius and deserving of praise. \nAlthough they started off on the wrong foot, Lieutenant Hendricks and Strike, her commander, develop a friendship and appreciation for each other. They bond over their deep hatred of Admiral Gorman and the joy of piloting a ship. She soon proves herself to Strike, and he begins to trust her. Their relationship walks the fine line between friendship and romance. \nAs the Aphrodite is attempting to rescue the fallen dreadnaughts, Lieutenant Hendricks comes up with the solution. Due to her constant tinkering on the ship, she had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat and made it ready to use. Initially, no one trusts her, seeing as the last time it was used people died. But Strike’s trust in her is strong and true, so he approves the use of the surge-circuit. Hendricks pilots the ship, but soon becomes too overheated and comes close to fainting. Strike takes over piloting and eventually activates the surge-circuit. It works and they are able to rescue the two ships, one of which had Admiral Gorman, her sworn enemy, onboard. \nLieutenant Hendricks receives a major promotion; she is now an engineer at the Bureau of Ships. She proved them wrong, and restored her father’s legacy and good name. The story ends with their romance left in the air, but Hendricks has much to be proud of. \n", "\nLieutenant Ivy Hendricks is the new Engineering Officer on Aphrodite. Strike and Cob assume that Ivy is a man before she arrives because they are sexist and because her name is listed as I.V. in the orders. Ivy is actually the daughter of the man who designed the award-winning craft.\n\nShe is cold and unfriendly towards Strike after she meets him, and that’s probably because he makes a rude comment about the ship which her father created. After a couple weeks of working together, the two begin to get along very well. Strike admires Ivy’s piloting skills and her depth of knowledge about the Aphrodite. \n\nThe two also bond over their shared hatred of Strike’s former boss, Gorman. Strike feels as though he has ruined his career, and Ivy thinks that Gorman torpedoed her father’s career. Ivy wants nothing more than to prove that Gorman is an idiot. \n\nHowever, when Gorman’s ship is hurtling towards the sun and he and his crew members are about to die, Ivy sees that it’s the perfect opportunity to show Gorman just how wrong he was about the ship her father designed. It’s a very dangerous mission, but Ivy is steadfast in her decision and she’s deeply courageous. She pilots the ship for most of the rescue mission, but eventually faints from the extreme heat. She tells Strike that he needs to take over, and he does a great job. \n\nIvy is then promoted, and she moves to Canalopolis, Mars. She now outranks her former Captain, Strike. \n", "Ivy Hendricks is the engineering officer assigned to the Aphrodite. She is the daughter of Harlan Hendricks, the ship's original designer. She is fiercely protective of her father's legacy and resents Admiral Gorman for the way he treated him.\n\nHendricks and Strike, form an alliance of sorts after his initial surprise of seeing a woman assigned to this officer's role. When news arrives that two ships are in danger of falling into the sun, Ivy lobbies to use her father's technology to save the ship. Strike agrees to her plan although the risks are high. The Aphrodite eventually saves the ships although Ivy faints in the process from the heat and command has to be taken over by Strike.\n\nThe successful mission results in a promotion for Ivy as she works as a designer in the Bureau of Ships like her father.", "Ivy Hendricks is the new engineering officer on the Aphrodite, having been transferred from the Antigone. She is a tall woman with dark hair and contrasting pale blue eyes, who has a very wide range of experience in ship operations and engineering. Her father, Harlan Hendricks, was the man who designed the Aphrodite, so she knows the ship needs a lot of specific training. At first, the captain did not expect her to be a woman, and managed to imply that many people found her father incompetent. Although she seemed cold at first, as she reacted to the situation, she and the captain eventually got along fairly well, as he learned to appreciate her wide skill set that ranged from engineering to piloting. Ivy and Strike also had a common enemy in the higher ranks: Space Admiral Gorman. Once Spike trusted her he appreciated that Ivy spent a lot of spare time working on the old circuits, so she knew the ship like the back of her hand. When the Aphrodite found the Lachesis and the Atropos when following up on a distress signal, Ivy new the ship well enough to be able to formulate a plan to save everyone. She piloted the Aphrodite carefully, using cables shot with a rocket to connect the three ships together, but the spinning of the ships in the heat inside meant that she passed out and had to leave Strike to take over for her. Her plan was successful; she was promoted, and instead of returning to the Aphrodite she started a design job with the Bureau of Ships."]}}

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship.

The fantastically misnamed\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten\nyears back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation\nIncident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a\nsurge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the\nplanner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its\nformative stage, and at the time of the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  launching the\nsurge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.\n  \n \n  Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit\nfor her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed\nof hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The\n   \n   Artemis\n   \n  , the\n   \n   Andromeda\n   \n  , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The\nthree vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid\nhad set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.\n  \n \n  All three were miserable failures.\n  \n \n  The eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuit\ntoo appealing to their hot little hands. They used it ... in some way,\nwrongly.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Artemis\n   \n  exploded. The\n   \n   Andromeda\n   \n  vanished in the general\ndirection of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of a\nruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions.\nAnd the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  starboard tubes blew, causing her to spend her\nstore of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under\n20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were a\ntangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  was refitted for space. And because it was an integral\npart of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. She became\na workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. She\ncarried personnel.... She trucked ores. She ferried skeeterboats and\ntanked rocket fuel. Now, she would carry the mail. She would lift from\nVenusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation.\nRegulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet\nrequired it. And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to see\nto it that she did....\n  \n \n  The Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys saluted\nsmartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve.\n  \n \n  Strike felt vaguely uncomfortable. He knew, of course, that at least a\nthird of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner Planet\nFleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a ship\nof his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere.\n  \n \n  Cob sensed his discomfort. \"That was Celia Graham, Strike. Ensign.\nRadar Officer. She's good, too.\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Don't like women in space. They make me\nuncomfortable.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged. \"Celia's the only officer. But about a quarter of our\nratings are women.\" He grinned maliciously. \"Equal rights, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"No doubt,\" commented the other sourly. \"Is that why they named\nthis ... ship 'Aphrodite'?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent.\n  \n \n  Strike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridge\nbulkhead. Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungle\nof chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into an\nacceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit\nrheostat.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?\" commented Cob.\n  \n \n  Strykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  flying-bridge. \"But she's home to us, anyway.\"\n  \n \n  The thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship,\nhugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. Strike\nreached for the squawk-box control.\n  \n \n  \"Now hear this. All officer personnel will assemble in the flying\nbridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. Officer of the Deck will\nrecall any enlisted personnel now on liberty....\"\n  \n \n  Whitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner.\n\"Orders, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here.\nThey're sending someone down from the\n   \n   Antigone\n   \n  , and I expect him by\n600 hours. In the meantime you'll take over his part of the work. See\nto it that we are fueled and ready to lift ship by 602. Base will start\nloading the mail at 599:30. That's about all.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir.\" Whitley saluted and turned to go. At the bulkhead, he\npaused. \"Captain,\" he asked, \"Who is the new E/O to be?\"\n  \n \n  Strike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. \"A Lieutenant\nHendricks, I. V. Hendricks, is what the orders say.\"\n  \n \n  Cob thought hard for a moment and then shrugged his shoulders. \"I. V.\nHendricks.\" He shook his head. \"Don't know him.\"\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_3]\nThe other officers of the\n   \n   T.R.S. Aphrodite\n   \n  were in conference with\nthe Captain when Cob and the girl at his side reached the flying\nbridge. She was tall and dark-haired with regular features and pale\nblue eyes. She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the\nshoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the\nobvious trimness of her figure.\n  \n \n  Strike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others.\n  \n \n  \"... and that's about the story. We are to jet within 28,000,000 miles\nof Sol. Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. With Mars in opposition,\nwe have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant.

Lieutenant\n   \n   I-vy\n   \n  Hendricks?\"\n  \n \n  Strike looked blankly at the girl.\n  \n \n  \"Our new E/O, Captain,\" prompted Whitley.\n  \n \n  \"Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks,\" was all the Captain could find\nto say.\n  \n \n  The girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. \"Thank you, Captain.\" Her\nvoice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. \"If I may have your\npermission to inspect the drives, Captain, I\n   \n   may\n   \n  be able to\nconvince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seem\nto think ... a senile incompetent.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was perplexed, and he showed it. \"Why, certainly ... uh ...\nMiss ... but why should you be so....\"\n  \n \n  The girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, \"Harlan\nHendricks, Captain, is my father.\"\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_4]\nA week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.\nJetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  had burned a\nsteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall\nwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected\nrepairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running\nten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation\nOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the\norbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....\n  \n \n  For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike\nand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in\nspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between\nthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\n  \n \n  And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was\ndedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.\nThere's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.\n  \n \n  At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  refrigeration\nunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable\ntemperature. The thermometer stood at 102°F, the very metal of\nthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,\ninsignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and\nspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the\nsodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to\ntheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.\n  \n \n  Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham\ncalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward. The\nIFF showed the pips to be the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  . The two\ndreadnaughts were engaged in coronary research patrol ... a purely\nroutine business.

Longevity wasn't developed until around the year 3000—Lee here was one of the first to profit by it, if you remember—and suspended animation is still to come. So there's one theory you can forget.\" \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said reluctantly. \"An atomic-powered ship couldn't have made such a trip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant project couldn't have lasted through forty generations, speculative fiction to the contrary—the later generations would have been too far removed in ideology and intent from their ancestors. They'd have adapted to shipboard life as the norm. They'd have atrophied physically, perhaps even have mutated—\" \"And they'd never have fought past the Bees during the Hymenop invasion and occupation,\" Farrell finished triumphantly. \"The Bees had better detection equipment than we had. They'd have picked this ship up long before it reached Alphard Six.\" \"But the ship wasn't here in 3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is now. Therefore it must have arrived at some time during the two hundred years of Hymenop occupation and evacuation.\" Farrell, tangled in contradictions, swore bitterly. \"But why should the Bees let them through? The three domes on Five are over two hundred years old, which means that the Bees were here before the ship came. Why didn't they blast it or enslave its crew?\" \"We haven't touched on all the possibilities,\" Gibson reminded him. \"We haven't even established yet that these people were never under Hymenop control. Precedent won't hold always, and there's no predicting nor evaluating the motives of an alien race. We never understood the Hymenops because there's no common ground of logic between us. Why try to interpret their intentions now?\" Farrell threw up his hands in disgust. \"Next you'll say this is an ancient Terran expedition that actually succeeded! There's only one way to answer the questions we've raised, and that's to go down and see for ourselves. Ready, Xav?\" But uncertainty nagged uneasily at him when Farrell found himself alone in the helihopper with the forest flowing beneath like a leafy river and Xavier's scouter disappearing bulletlike into the dusk ahead. We never found a colony so advanced, Farrell thought. Suppose this is a Hymenop experiment that really paid off? The Bees did some weird and wonderful things with human guinea pigs—what if they've created the ultimate booby trap here, and primed it with conditioned myrmidons in our own form? Suppose, he thought—and derided himself for thinking it—one of those suicidal old interstellar ventures did succeed? Xavier's voice, a mellow drone from the helihopper's Ringwave-powered visicom, cut sharply into his musing. \"The ship has discovered the scouter and is training an electronic beam upon it. My instruments record an electromagnetic vibration pattern of low power but rapidly varying frequency. The operation seems pointless.\" Stryker's voice followed, querulous with worry: \"I'd better pull Xav back. It may be something lethal.\" \"Don't,\" Gibson's baritone advised. Surprisingly, there was excitement in the engineer's voice. \"I think they're trying to communicate with us.\" Farrell was on the point of demanding acidly to know how one went about communicating by means of a fluctuating electric field when the unexpected cessation of forest diverted his attention. The helihopper scudded over a cultivated area of considerable extent, fields stretching below in a vague random checkerboard of lighter and darker earth, an undefined cluster of buildings at their center. There was a central bonfire that burned like a wild red eye against the lower gloom, and in its plunging ruddy glow he made out an urgent scurrying of shadowy figures. \"I'm passing over a hamlet,\" Farrell reported. \"The one nearest the city, I think. There's something odd going on down—\" Catastrophe struck so suddenly that he was caught completely unprepared. The helihopper's flimsy carriage bucked and crumpled. There was a blinding flare of electric discharge, a pungent stink of ozone and a stunning shock that flung him headlong into darkness. He awoke slowly with a brutal headache and a conviction of nightmare heightened by the outlandish tone of his surroundings. He lay on a narrow bed in a whitely antiseptic infirmary, an oblong metal cell cluttered with a grimly utilitarian array of tables and lockers and chests. The lighting was harsh and overbright and the air hung thick with pungent unfamiliar chemical odors. From somewhere, far off yet at the same time as near as the bulkhead above him, came the unceasing drone of machinery. Farrell sat up, groaning, when full consciousness made his position clear. He had been shot down by God knew what sort of devastating unorthodox weapon and was a prisoner in the grounded ship. At his rising, a white-smocked fat man with anachronistic spectacles and close-cropped gray hair came into the room, moving with the professional assurance of a medic. The man stopped short at Farrell's stare and spoke; his words were utterly unintelligible, but his gesture was unmistakable. Farrell followed him dumbly out of the infirmary and down a bare corridor whose metal floor rang coldly underfoot. An open port near the corridor's end relieved the blankness of wall and let in a flood of reddish Alphardian sunlight; Farrell slowed to look out, wondering how long he had lain unconscious, and felt panic knife at him when he saw Xavier's scouter lying, port open and undefended, on the square outside. The mechanical had been as easily taken as himself, then. Stryker and Gibson, for all their professional caution, would fare no better—they could not have overlooked the capture of Farrell and Xavier, and when they tried as a matter of course to rescue them the Marco would be struck down in turn by the same weapon. The fat medic turned and said something urgent in his unintelligible tongue. Farrell, dazed by the enormity of what had happened, followed without protest into an intersecting way that led through a bewildering succession of storage rooms and hydroponics gardens, through a small gymnasium fitted with physical training equipment in graduated sizes and finally into a soundproofed place that could have been nothing but a nursery. The implication behind its presence stopped Farrell short. \"A creche ,\" he said, stunned. He had a wild vision of endless generations of children growing up in this dim and stuffy room, to be taught from their first toddling steps the functions they must fulfill before the venture of which they were a part could be consummated. One of those old ventures had succeeded, he thought, and was awed by the daring of that thousand-year odyssey. The realization left him more alarmed than before—for what technical marvels might not an isolated group of such dogged specialists have developed during a millennium of application? Such a weapon as had brought down the helihopper and scouter was patently beyond reach of his own latter-day technology. Perhaps, he thought, its possession explained the presence of these people here in the first stronghold of the Hymenops; perhaps they had even fought and defeated the Bees on their own invaded ground. He followed his white-smocked guide through a power room where great crude generators whirred ponderously, pouring out gross electric current into arm-thick cables. They were nearing the bow of the ship when they passed by another open port and Farrell, glancing out over the lowered rampway, saw that his fears for Stryker and Gibson had been well grounded. The Marco Four , ports open, lay grounded outside. Farrell could not have said, later, whether his next move was planned or reflexive. The whole desperate issue seemed to hang suspended for a breathless moment upon a hair-fine edge of decision, and in that instant he made his bid. Without pausing in his stride he sprang out and through the port and down the steep plane of the ramp. The rough stone pavement of the square drummed underfoot; sore muscles tore at him, and weakness was like a weight about his neck. He expected momentarily to be blasted out of existence. He reached the Marco Four with the startled shouts of his guide ringing unintelligibly in his ears. The port yawned; he plunged inside and stabbed at controls without waiting to seat himself. The ports swung shut. The ship darted up under his manipulation and arrowed into space with an acceleration that sprung his knees and made his vision swim blackly. He was so weak with strain and with the success of his coup that he all but fainted when Stryker, his scanty hair tousled and his fat face comical with bewilderment, stumbled out of his sleeping cubicle and bellowed at him. \"What the hell are you doing, Arthur? Take us down!\" Farrell gaped at him, speechless. Stryker lumbered past him and took the controls, spiraling the Marco Four down. Men swarmed outside the ports when the Reclamations craft settled gently to the square again. Gibson and Xavier reached the ship first; Gibson came inside quickly, leaving the mechanical outside making patient explanations to an excited group of Alphardians. Gibson put a reassuring hand on Farrell's\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_6]\nLashed together with a length of unbreakable beryllium steel cable,\nthe\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  fell helplessly toward the sun.

Strike, however, did not follow in his family’s footsteps. \n\tWith a tendency to say the wrong thing at the wrong time, Strike often offended those around him and garnered a negative reputation. After being put in charge of the Ganymede, he soon lost his position after abandoning his station to rescue colonists who were not in danger. As well, he accused a Martian Ambassador of being a spy at a respectable ball. Admiral Gorman soon demoted him, and he became the commander of the Aphrodite. \n\tAt first, Strike was not a fan. He sees her as ugly, fat, and cantankerous. He misses the Ganymede, a shiny and new rocketship, and views the Aphrodite as less-than. \n\tWithin the first week of flying her, the Aphrodite had a burned steering tube, which made it necessary to go into free-fall as the damage control party made repairs. Strike’s faith in Lover-Girl continued to plummet. \n\tHowever, after Lieutenant Hendricks, the resident engineer, got her hands on the Aphrodite, Strike’s opinion started to change. Her knowledge of the ship, engineering, and piloting helped him gain confidence in both her abilities and those of Aphrodite.\nNear the end of the story, the Aphrodite is tasked with rescuing two ships that are falling into the sun.

His perception of the ship at the beginning of the story is colored by this history, and his first impression of the ship is not a positive one, even from the outside. Besides the actual construction of the ship, the technology that ran it was not something he showed much faith in. The first week that he was in charge after leaving Venus, it seemed things were going drastically wrong. When one important piece of equipment burnt out, the ship went into freefall, requiring a lot of repair work from the engineers, and anyone in charge of navigation was handed more work because of this as well. The ship was really put to the test when the Aphrodite responded to the distress call from the Lachesis, whose crew was trying to keep the Atropos from falling into the sun. Because Ivy knew the Aphrodite so well, and had been working on the circuits, it turned out the Aphrodite was the perfect ship to save the day. She could not see the rescue all the way through to the end, because she passed out early, but Strike was conscious a little bit longer and took over until he also passed out. After this unexpected rescue mission, Cob, the Executive Officer, noted that Strike has a newfound appreciation for the ship, and has no intention of leaving. Strike is dedicated to his new mission, even though at the beginning of the story he wanted nothing more than to pilot something the same rank as his old ship."]}}

She wore a service jumper with two silver stripes on the\nshoulder-straps, and even the shapeless garment could not hide the\nobvious trimness of her figure.\n  \n \n  Strike's back was toward the bulkhead, and he was addressing the others.\n  \n \n  \"... and that's about the story. We are to jet within 28,000,000 miles\nof Sol. Orbit is trans-Mercurian hyperbolic. With Mars in opposition,\nwe have to make a perihelion run and it won't be pleasant. But I'm\ncertain this old boiler can take it. I understand the old boy who\ndesigned her wasn't as incompetent as they say. But Space Regs are\nspecific about mail runs. This is important to you, Evans. Your\nastrogation has to be accurate to within twenty-five miles plus or\nminus the shortest route. And there'll be no breaking orbit.

Lieutenant\n   \n   I-vy\n   \n  Hendricks?\"\n  \n \n  Strike looked blankly at the girl.\n  \n \n  \"Our new E/O, Captain,\" prompted Whitley.\n  \n \n  \"Uh ... welcome aboard, Miss Hendricks,\" was all the Captain could find\nto say.\n  \n \n  The girl's eyes were cold and unfriendly. \"Thank you, Captain.\" Her\nvoice was like cracked ice tinkling in a glass. \"If I may have your\npermission to inspect the drives, Captain, I\n   \n   may\n   \n  be able to\nconvince you that the designer of this vessel was not ... as you seem\nto think ... a senile incompetent.\"\n  \n \n  Strike was perplexed, and he showed it. \"Why, certainly ... uh ...\nMiss ... but why should you be so....\"\n  \n \n  The girl's voice was even colder than before as she said, \"Harlan\nHendricks, Captain, is my father.\"\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_4]\nA week in space had convinced Strike that he commanded a jinx ship.\nJetting sunward from Venus, the cantankerous\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  had burned a\nsteering tube through, and it had been necessary to go into free-fall\nwhile Jenkins, the Assistant E/O, and a damage control party effected\nrepairs. When the power was again applied, Old Aphrodisiac was running\nten hours behind schedule, and Strike and Evans, the Astrogation\nOfficer, were sweating out the unforeseen changes introduced into the\norbital calculations by the time spent in free-fall.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  rumbled on toward the orbit of Mercury....\n  \n \n  For all the tension between the occupants of the flying-bridge, Strike\nand Ivy Hendricks worked well together. And after a second week in\nspace, a reluctant admiration was replacing the resentment between\nthem. Ivy spent whatever time she could spare tinkering with her\nfather's pet surge-circuit and Strike began to realize that there was\nlittle she did not know about spaceship engineering. Then, too, Ivy\nspent a lot of time at the controls, and Strike was forced to admit\nthat he had never seen a finer job of piloting done by man or woman.\n  \n \n  And finally, Ivy hated old Brass-bottom Gorman even more than Strike\ndid. She felt that Gorman had ruined her father's career, and she was\ndedicating her life to proving her father right and Brass-bottom wrong.\nThere's nothing in the cosmos to nurture friendship like a common enemy.\n  \n \n  At 30,000,000 miles from the sun, the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  refrigeration\nunits could no longer keep the interior of the ship at a comfortable\ntemperature. The thermometer stood at 102°F, the very metal of\nthe ship's fittings hot to the touch. Uniforms were discarded,\ninsignia of rank vanished. The men dressed in fiberglass shorts and\nspaceboots, sweat making their naked bodies gleam like copper under the\nsodium-vapor lights. The women in the crew added only light blouses to\ntheir shorts ... and suffered from extra clothing.\n  \n \n  Strike was in the observation blister forward, when Ensign Graham\ncalled to say that she had picked up a radar contact sunward.

There's no one down there at all—we're victims of the first joint hallucination in psychiatric history.\" Stryker threw up his hands in surrender. \"We can't identify them by theorizing, and that brings us down to the business of first-hand investigation. Who's going to bell the cat this time?\" \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said at once. \"The ZIT computer can wait.\" Stryker vetoed his offer as promptly. \"No, the ZIT comes first. We may have to run for it, and we can't set up a Transfer jump without the computer. It's got to be me or Arthur.\" Farrell felt the familiar chill of uneasiness that inevitably preceded this moment of decision. He was not lacking in courage, else the circumstances under which he had worked for the past ten years—the sometimes perilous, sometimes downright charnel conditions left by the fleeing Hymenop conquerors—would have broken him long ago. But that same hard experience had honed rather than blunted the edge of his imagination, and the prospect of a close-quarters stalking of an unknown and patently hostile force was anything but attractive. \"You two did the field work on the last location,\" he said. \"It's high time I took my turn—and God knows I'd go mad if I had to stay inship and listen to Lee memorizing his Handbook subsections or to Gib practicing dead languages with Xavier.\" Stryker laughed for the first time since the explosion that had so nearly wrecked the Marco Four . \"Good enough. Though it wouldn't be more diverting to listen for hours to you improvising enharmonic variations on the Lament for Old Terra with your accordion.\" Gibson, characteristically, had a refinement to offer. \"They'll be alerted down there for a reconnaissance sally,\" he said. \"Why not let Xavier take the scouter down for overt diversion, and drop Arthur off in the helihopper for a low-level check?\" Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All right, Arthur?\" \"Good enough,\" Farrell said. And to Xavier, who had not moved from his post at the magnoscanner: \"How does it look, Xav? Have you pinned down their base yet?\" The mechanical answered him in a voice as smooth and clear—and as inflectionless—as a 'cello note. \"The planet seems uninhabited except for a large island some three hundred miles in diameter. There are twenty-seven small agrarian hamlets surrounded by cultivated fields. There is one city of perhaps a thousand buildings with a central square. In the square rests a grounded spaceship of approximately ten times the bulk of the Marco Four .\" They crowded about the vision screen, jostling Xavier's jointed gray shape in their interest. The central city lay in minutest detail before them, the battered hulk of the grounded ship glinting rustily in the late afternoon sunlight. Streets radiated away from the square in orderly succession, the whole so clearly depicted that they could see the throngs of people surging up and down, tiny foreshortened faces turned toward the sky. \"At least they're human,\" Farrell said. Relief replaced in some measure his earlier uneasiness. \"Which means that they're Terran, and can be dealt with according to Reclamations routine. Is that hulk spaceworthy, Xav?\" Xavier's mellow drone assumed the convention vibrato that indicated stark puzzlement. \"Its breached hull makes the ship incapable of flight. Apparently it is used only to supply power to the outlying hamlets.\" The mechanical put a flexible gray finger upon an indicator graph derived from a composite section of detector meters. \"The power transmitted seems to be gross electric current conveyed by metallic cables. It is generated through a crudely governed process of continuous atomic fission.\" Farrell, himself appalled by the information, still found himself able to chuckle at Stryker's bellow of consternation. \" Continuous fission? Good God, only madmen would deliberately run a risk like that!\" Farrell prodded him with cheerful malice. \"Why say mad men ? Maybe they're humanoid aliens who thrive on hard radiation and look on the danger of being blown to hell in the middle of the night as a satisfactory risk.\" \"They're not alien,\" Gibson said positively. \"Their architecture is Terran, and so is their ship. The ship is incredibly primitive, though; those batteries of tubes at either end—\" \"Are thrust reaction jets,\" Stryker finished in an awed voice. \"Primitive isn't the word, Gib—the thing is prehistoric! Rocket propulsion hasn't been used in spacecraft since—how long, Xav?\" Xavier supplied the information with mechanical infallibility. \"Since the year 2100 when the Ringwave propulsion-communication principle was discovered. That principle has served men since.\" Farrell stared in blank disbelief at the anomalous craft on the screen. Primitive, as Stryker had said, was not the word for it: clumsily ovoid, studded with torpedo domes and turrets and bristling at either end with propulsion tubes, it lay at the center of its square like a rusted relic of a past largely destroyed and all but forgotten. What a magnificent disregard its builders must have had, he thought, for their lives and the genetic purity of their posterity! The sullen atomic fires banked in that oxidizing hulk— Stryker said plaintively, \"If you're right, Gib, then we're more in the dark than ever. How could a Terran-built ship eleven hundred years old get here ?\" Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's contemplation of alternatives, seemed hardly to hear him. \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson said. \"If it's a Terran artifact, we can discover the reason for its presence. If not—\" \" Any problem posed by one group of human beings ,\" Stryker quoted his Handbook, \" can be resolved by any other group, regardless of ideology or conditioning, because the basic perceptive abilities of both must be the same through identical heredity .\" \"If it's an imitation, and this is another Hymenop experiment in condition ecology, then we're stumped to begin with,\" Gibson finished. \"Because we're not equipped to evaluate the psychology of alien motivation. We've got to determine first which case applies here.\" He waited for Farrell's expected irony, and when the navigator forestalled him by remaining grimly quiet, continued. \"The obvious premise is that a Terran ship must have been built by Terrans. Question: Was it flown here, or built here?\" \"It couldn't have been built here,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard Six was surveyed just before the Bees took over in 3025, and there was nothing of the sort here then. It couldn't have been built during the two and a quarter centuries since; it's obviously much older than that. It was flown here.\" \"We progress,\" Farrell said dryly. \"Now if you'll tell us how , we're ready to move.\" \"I think the ship was built on Terra during the Twenty-second Century,\" Gibson said calmly. \"The atomic wars during that period destroyed practically all historical records along with the technology of the time, but I've read well-authenticated reports of atomic-driven ships leaving Terra before then for the nearer stars. The human race climbed out of its pit again during the Twenty-third Century and developed the technology that gave us the Ringwave. Certainly no atomic-powered ships were built after the wars—our records are complete from that time.\" Farrell shook his head at the inference. \"I've read any number of fanciful romances on the theme, Gib, but it won't stand up in practice. No shipboard society could last through a thousand-year space voyage. It's a physical and psychological impossibility. There's got to be some other explanation.\" Gibson shrugged. \"We can only eliminate the least likely alternatives and accept the simplest one remaining.\" \"Then we can eliminate this one now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It entails a thousand-year voyage, which is an impossibility for any gross reaction drive; the application of suspended animation or longevity or a successive-generation program, and a final penetration of Hymenop-occupied space to set up a colony under the very antennae of the Bees. Longevity wasn't developed until around the year 3000—Lee here was one of the first to profit by it, if you remember—and suspended animation is still to come. So there's one theory you can forget.\" \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said reluctantly. \"An atomic-powered ship couldn't have made such a trip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant project couldn't have lasted through forty generations, speculative fiction to the contrary—the later generations would have been too far removed in ideology and intent from their ancestors. They'd have adapted to shipboard life as the norm. They'd have atrophied physically, perhaps even have mutated—\" \"And they'd never have fought past the Bees during the Hymenop invasion and occupation,\" Farrell finished triumphantly. \"The Bees had better detection equipment than we had. They'd have picked this ship up long before it reached Alphard Six.\" \"But the ship wasn't here in 3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is now. Therefore it must have arrived at some time during the two hundred years of Hymenop occupation and evacuation.\" Farrell, tangled in contradictions, swore bitterly. \"But why should the Bees let them through? The three domes on Five are over two hundred years old,\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_7]\nThe orchestra was subdued, the officer's club softly lighted. Cob\nleaned his elbow on the bar and bent to inspect the blue ribbon of the\nSpatial Cross on Strike's chest. Then he inspected his own and nodded\nwith tipsy satisfaction. He stared out at the Martian night beyond the\nbroad windows and back again at Strike. His frown was puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" said Strike, setting down his glass. \"What's on your mind,\nCob? Something's eating you.\"\n  \n \n  Whitley nodded very slowly. He took a long pull at his highball. \"I\nunderstand that you goofballed your chances of getting the\n   \n   Ganymede\n   \n  back when Gorman spoke his piece to you....\"\n  \n \n  \"All I said to him....\"\n  \n \n  \"I know.

Ivy's a nice girl ... but....\" He paused and\nsighed. \"Since she was promoted to her father's old rank ... well....\"\nHe shrugged. \"Who wants a wife that ranks you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never thought of that,\" mused Cob. For a long while he was silent;\nthen he pulled out an address book and leafed through until he came to\nthe pages marked \"Canalopolis, Mars.\"\n  \n \n  And he was gratified to see that Lieutenant Commander David Farragut\nStrykalski III was doing the same.\n\n[Chapter: Jinx_Ship_To_The_Rescue_5]\nOld Aphrodisiac had reached perihelion when it happened. The\nthermometer stood at 135° and tempers were snapping. Cob and Celia\nGraham had tangled about some minor point concerning Lover-Girl's\nweight and balance. Ivy went about her work on the bridge without\nspeaking, and Strike made no attempt to brighten her sudden depression.\nLieutenant Evans had punched Bayne, the Tactical Astrophysicist,\nin the eye for some disparaging remark about Southern California\nwomanhood. The ratings were grumbling about the food....\n  \n \n  And then it happened.\n  \n \n  Cob was in the radio room when Sparks pulled the flimsy from the\nscrambler. It was a distress signal from the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  . The\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  had burst a fission chamber and was falling into the sun.\nRadiation made a transfer of personnel impossible, and the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  skeeterboats didn't have the power to pull away from the looming star.\nThe\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  had a line on the sister dreadnaught and was valiantly\ntrying to pull the heavy vessel to safety, but even the thundering\npower of the\n   \n   Lachesis'\n   \n  mighty drive wasn't enough to break Sol's\ndeathgrip on the battleship.\n  \n \n  A fleet of souped-up space-tugs was on its way from Luna and Venusport,\nbut they could not possibly arrive on time. And it was doubtful that\neven the tugs had the necessary power to drag the crippled\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  away from a fiery end.\n  \n \n  Cob snatched the flimsy from Sparks' hands and galloped for the\nflying-bridge. He burst in and waved the message excitedly in front of\nStrykalski's face.\n  \n \n  \"Have a look at this! Ye gods and little catfish! Read it!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, dammit, hold it still so I can!\" snapped Strike. He read the\nmessage and passed it to Ivy Hendricks with a shake of his head.\n  \n \n  She read it through and looked up exultantly. \"This is\n   \n   it\n   \n  ! This is\nthe chance I've been praying for, Strike!\"\n  \n \n  He returned her gaze sourly. \"For Gorman to fall into the sun? I recall\nI said something of the sort myself, but there are other men on those\nships. And, if I know Captain Varni on the\n   \n   Lachesis\n   \n  , he won't let go\nthat line even if he fries himself.\"\n  \n \n  Ivy's eyes snapped angrily. \"That's not what I meant, and you know it!\nI mean this!\" She touched the red-sealed surge-circuit rheostat.\n  \n \n  \"That's very nice, Lieutenant,\" commented Cob drily. \"And I know that\nyou've been very busy adjusting that gismo. But I seem to recall that\nthe last time that circuit was uncorked everyone aboard became part of\nthe woodwork ... very messily, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let me understand you, Ivy,\" said Strike in a flat voice. \"What you\nare suggesting is that I risk my ship and the lives of all of us trying\nto pull old Gorman's fat out of the fire with a drive that's blown\nskyhigh three times out of three. Very neat.\"\n  \n \n  There were tears bright in Ivy Hendricks' eyes and she sounded\ndesperate. \"But we can save those ships! We can, I\n   \n   know\n   \n  we can! My\nfather designed this ship! I know every rivet of her! Those idiots off\nCallisto didn't know what they were doing. These ships needed specially\ntrained men. Father told them that! And I'm trained!

The hot, slimy, greenish rain that drenched Venusport\nfor two-thirds of the 720-hour day had stopped at last, but now a\nmiasmic fog was rising from the surrounding swampland, rolling across\nthe mushy landing ramp toward the grounded spaceship.

The\nfrantic flame that lashed out from the\n   \n   Lachesis'\n   \n  tube was fading, her\nfission chambers fusing under the terrific heat of splitting atoms.\nStill she tried. She could not desert her sister ship, nor could she\nsave her. Already the two ships had fallen to within 18,000,000 miles\nof the sun's terrifying atmosphere of glowing gases. The prominences\nthat spouted spaceward seemed like great fiery tentacles reaching for\nthe trapped men on board the warships. The atmospheric guiding fins,\nthe gun-turrets and other protuberances on both ships were beginning\nto melt under the fierce radiance. Only the huge refrigeration plants\non the vessels made life within them possible. And, even so, men were\ndying.\n  \n \n  Swiftly, the fat, ungainly shape of old Aphrodisiac drew near. In her\nflying-bridge, Strike and Ivy Hendricks watched the stricken ships in\nthe darkened viewport.\n  \n \n  The temperature stood at 140° and the air was bitter with the smell\nof hot metal. Ivy's blouse clung to her body, soaked through with\nperspiration. Sweat ran from her hair into her eyes and she gasped\nfor breath in the oven hot compartment. Strike watched her with\napprehension.\n  \n \n  Carefully, Ivy circled the two warships. From the starboard tube on\nthe gun-deck, a homing rocket leapt toward the\n   \n   Atropos\n   \n  . It plunged\nstraight and true, spilling cable as it flew. It slammed up against\nthe hull, and stuck there, fast to the battleship's flank. Quickly,\na robocrane drew it within the ship and the cable was made secure.\nLike cosmic replicas of the ancient South American \"bolas,\" the three\nspacecraft whirled in space ... and all three began that sunward plunge\ntogether.\n  \n \n \n \n   They were diving into the sun.\n   \n \n \n \n  The heat in the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  bridge was unbearable. The thermometer\nshowed 145° and it seemed to Strike that Hell must be cool by\ncomparison.\n  \n \n  Ivy fought her reeling senses and the bucking ship as the slack came\nout of the cable. Blackness was flickering at the edges of her field\nof vision. She could scarcely lift her hand to the red-sealed circuit\nrheostat. Shudderingly, she made the effort ... and failed. Conscious,\nbut too spent to move, she collapsed over the blistering hot instrument\npanel.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   Ivy!\n   \n  \" Strike was beside her, cradling her head in his arm.\n  \n \n  \"I ... I ... can't make it ... Strike. You'll ... have to run ... the\nshow ... after ... all.\"\n  \n \n  Strike laid her gently in an acceleration chair and turned toward the\ncontrol panel. His head was throbbing painfully as he broke the seal on\nthe surge-circuit.\n  \n \n  Slowly he turned the rheostat. Relays chattered. From deep within\nold Lover-Girl's vitals came a low whine. He fed more power into the\ncircuit. Cadmium rods slipped into lead sheaths decks below in the\ntube-rooms. The whining rose in pitch. The spinning of the ships in\nspace slowed. Stopped. With painful deliberation, they swung into line.\n  \n \n  More power. The whine changed to a shriek. A banshee wail.\n  \n \n  Cob's voice came through the squawk-box, soberly. \"Strike, Celia's\nfainted down here. We can't take much more of this heat.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're trying, Cob!\" shouted Strike over the whine of the circuit. The\ngauges showed the accumulators full. \"\n   \n   Now!\n   \n  \" He spun the rheostat to\nthe stops, and black space burst over his brain....\n  \n \n  The last thing he remembered was a voice.

The fantastically misnamed\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  was a surge-circuit monitor of twenty guns built some ten\nyears back in the period immediately preceding the Ionian Subjugation\nIncident. She had been designed primarily for atomics, with a\nsurge-circuit set-up for interstellar flight. At least that was the\nplanner's view. In those days, interstellar astrogation was in its\nformative stage, and at the time of the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  launching the\nsurge-circuit was hailed as the very latest in space drives.\n  \n \n  Her designer, Harlan Hendricks, had been awarded a Legion of Merit\nfor her, and every silver-braided admiral in the Fleet had dreamed\nof hoisting his flag on one of her class. There had been three. The\n   \n   Artemis\n   \n  , the\n   \n   Andromeda\n   \n  , and the prototype ... old Aphrodisiac. The\nthree vessels had gone into action off Callisto after the Phobos Raid\nhad set off hostilities between the Ionians and the Solarian Combine.\n  \n \n  All three were miserable failures.\n  \n \n  The eager officers commanding the three monitors had found the circuit\ntoo appealing to their hot little hands. They used it ... in some way,\nwrongly.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Artemis\n   \n  exploded. The\n   \n   Andromeda\n   \n  vanished in the general\ndirection of Coma Berenices glowing white hot from the heat of a\nruptured fission chamber and spewing gamma rays in all directions.\nAnd the\n   \n   Aphrodite's\n   \n  starboard tubes blew, causing her to spend her\nstore of vicious energy spinning like a Fourth of July pinwheel under\n20 gravities until all her interior fittings ... including crew were a\ntangled, pulpy mess within her pressure hull.\n  \n \n  The\n   \n   Aphrodite\n   \n  was refitted for space. And because it was an integral\npart of her design, the circuit was rebuilt ... and sealed. She became\na workhorse, growing more cantankerous with each passing year. She\ncarried personnel.... She trucked ores. She ferried skeeterboats and\ntanked rocket fuel. Now, she would carry the mail. She would lift from\nVenusport and jet to Canalopolis, Mars, without delay or variation.\nRegulations, tradition and Admiral Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet\nrequired it. And it was now up to David Farragut Strykalski III to see\nto it that she did....\n  \n \n  The Officer of the Deck, a trim blonde girl in spotless greys saluted\nsmartly as Strike and Cob stepped through the valve.\n  \n \n  Strike felt vaguely uncomfortable. He knew, of course, that at least a\nthird of the personnel on board non-combat vessels of the Inner Planet\nFleet was female, but he had never actually had women on board a ship\nof his own, and he felt quite certain that he preferred them elsewhere.\n  \n \n  Cob sensed his discomfort. \"That was Celia Graham, Strike. Ensign.\nRadar Officer. She's good, too.\"\n  \n \n  Strike shook his head. \"Don't like women in space. They make me\nuncomfortable.\"\n  \n \n  Cob shrugged. \"Celia's the only officer. But about a quarter of our\nratings are women.\" He grinned maliciously. \"Equal rights, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"No doubt,\" commented the other sourly. \"Is that why they named\nthis ... ship 'Aphrodite'?\"\n  \n \n  Whitley saw fit to consider the question rhetorical and remained silent.\n  \n \n  Strike lowered his head to clear the arch of the flying-bridge\nbulkhead. Cob followed. He trailed his Captain through a jungle\nof chrome piping to the main control panels. Strike sank into an\nacceleration chair in front of the red DANGER seal on the surge-circuit\nrheostat.\n  \n \n  \"Looks like a drug-store fountain, doesn't it?\" commented Cob.\n  \n \n  Strykalski nodded sadly, thinking of the padded smoothness of the\n   \n   Ganymede's\n   \n  flying-bridge. \"But she's home to us, anyway.\"\n  \n \n  The thick Venusian fog had closed in around the top levels of the ship,\nhugging the ports and cutting off all view of the field outside. Strike\nreached for the squawk-box control.\n  \n \n  \"Now hear this. All officer personnel will assemble in the flying\nbridge at 600 hours for Captain's briefing. Officer of the Deck will\nrecall any enlisted personnel now on liberty....\"\n  \n \n  Whitley was on his feet, all the slackness gone from his manner.\n\"Orders, Captain?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't do anything until the new Engineering Officer gets here.\nThey're sending someone down from the\n   \n   Antigone\n   \n  , and I expect him by\n600 hours.

At the bulkhead, he\npaused. \"Captain,\" he asked, \"Who is the new E/O to be?\"\n  \n \n  Strike stretched his long legs out on the steel deck. \"A Lieutenant\nHendricks, I. V.

He comes from a long line of decorated military officers but struggles to live up to his family's legacy. He has a history of insubordination and poor judgment calls, which led to his demotion from a prestigious command to the undesirable spaceship, the *Aphrodite*. His personality is a primary source of his career troubles.\n\n**Step 2: Detail Strike's personal flaws and past mistakes.**\nStrike admits he has a talent for causing trouble, particularly with his superiors like Admiral Gorman. He lost his previous command, the *Ganymede*, by abandoning his post on a hunch to rescue colonists, which turned out to be a false alarm. This history of bucking authority and making questionable decisions has earned him his current, undesirable assignment.\n\n##begin_quote##\nIn the first place I seem to have an uncanny talent for saying the wrong thing to the wrong person. Gorman for example. And I take too much on my own initiative. Gorman doesn't like that. I lost the Ganymede....\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 3: Describe the initial challenge of his new command.**\nStrike is assigned to the *T.R.S. Aphrodite*, an old, ugly, and notoriously unreliable monitor ship with a history of catastrophic failures. It is considered a \"jinx ship.\" Compounding his displeasure with the vessel is his personal prejudice against having women serve on his ship, a bias that is immediately challenged\n\n##Answer: "}], "metadata": {"id": "514", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 1, "reference_answers": ["Strike is a member of an esteemed service family on Venus; seven generations of well-behaved and well-trained operators. Unfortunately, Strike struggles to carry on the family tradition, and is known for misspeaking and offending those around him. By trusting his gut, he wound up failing his higher-ups and crew several times. All this culminated in an eventual mistrust of Strike, which led to him being charged with the Aphrodite. \n\tHis deep hatred of Space Admiral Gordon is passionate, but not without reason. Gordon is the one who demoted him to the Aphrodite. At the start, Strike is checking out his new vessel and notes how ugly the ship is. After examining the ship and it’s crew, it is revealed that Strike is uncomfortable around women and believes they don’t belong on a spaceship. \n\tIn order to start flying, he calls in an expert engineer to come aboard and travel with them. Thinking I.V. Hendricks is a man, he is excited to have them onboard. But when Ivy Hendricks shows up, a female engineer and the daughter of the Aphrodite’s creator, his world is soon turned upside down. \n\tHis initial negative reaction to her is soon displaced by begrudging appreciation and eventually trust and friendship. Hendricks proves his previous theories about women wrong, and Strike is forced to accept that perhaps women do belong on a spaceship. She especially impresses him with her total knowledge of spaceship engineering and the Aphrodite in general. And it helped that she hated Admiral Gorman just as much as Strike, if not more. \n\tWhile flying by the sun to deliver mail, the Aphrodite receives a distress call from two ships: the Lachesis and the Atropos, the latter of which carried Admiral Gorman onboard. After the Aphrodite reached orbit, the Lachesis reached out and reported the Atropos was falling into the sun, due to a burst chamber. They couldn’t move those onboard over thanks to all the radiation, so the Lachesis was attempting to pull the Atropos back using an unbreakable cord. But it wasn’t enough. \n\tSince Ivy Hendricks had fixed the surge-circuit rheostat--the feature that crashed the original Aphrodite--, they were able to save the Lachesis and the Atropos and regain some of their dignity and former glory. \n\tStrike is awarded the Spatial Cross, as well as Cob, his friend and longtime executive of the Aphrodite. Strike was asked to return to the Ganymede, a beautiful sleek ship, but allegedly said the wrong thing to Gorman, and was instead sent back to the Aphrodite. Cob believes he did it on purpose, as Strike had grown quite fond of Lover-Girl. \n\tIvy has gone to the Bureau of Ships to engineer vessels, a great upgrade from her previous job. Cob pressures Strike to reach out to her, but he refuses. However, it ends on a hopeful note, with the potential for romance between Strike and Hendricks, and even more adventures on the clunky Aphrodite. ", "Strike’s real name is Brevet Lieutenant Commander David Farragut Strykalski III. After serving on the Ganymede, he is put in charge of the Aphrodite. He comes from many generations of officers. However, he doesn’t feel like he fits the mold of his grandfather and great-grandfather and so on. His boss, Gorman, disagreed with several decisions he made in the past and sent him to work on the Aphrodite, the unimpressive spaceship.\n\nStrike does not like working with women in space, so he is disappointed when two of his crew members are powerful and successful females. He learns his lesson after working with Ivy Hendricks for a few weeks. She impresses him with her piloting skills and her knowledge of the ship that her father designed. \n\nStrike is skeptical at first when Ivy wants to take Aphrodite to rescue two ships whose crew members are in grave danger. He knows that the mistakes he made before got him on the Aphrodite, and there’s a big chance that he’ll be fired for trying to save the day, or worse, the mission could end in death for him and all of his crew members. He has feelings for Ivy, and her intense passion convinces him that she’s right, Aphrodite can handle the mission and they can save those peoples’ lives.\n\nIvy pilots the ship almost the entire route, but she is unable to finish the job when she passes out from the intense heat. Captain Strike takes over and saves the crews on the Atropos and the Lachesis. He is hailed as a hero, and he repairs his terrible reputation with the selfless act. He decides not to leave the Aphrodite. He wants to be loyal to the ship that worked so hard for him. He does decide to give Ivy a call. Even though she outranks him, he has to admit that he has a crush on her. ", "Strike is the commander of the Aphrodite. He was originally the commander of the prestigious Ganymede. However a number of decisions made out of bravado as well as some unprofessional comments lost him that command.\n\nNow in command of a dilapidated ship, Strike comes to terms with his job. He commands a crew including a large number of women which makes him somewhat uncomfortable. His engineering officer Ivy Hendricks in particular seems to be of romantic interest to Strike.\n\nStrike ends up teaming with Ivy to save two ships from falling into the sun earning him a small promotion but an ill-advised comment prevents him from leaving the Aphrodite, perhaps to the satisfaction of Strike himself.", "Strike is a highly decorated lieutenant commander in the Navy, who comes from a long line of ship operators. Although he has run many successful missions, he has a reputation of causing trouble—his new Executive Officer, Cob, has heard a number of stories that he asks Strike for details about. Strike has lost command of the ship that he had been captaining, and is sent by Admiral Gorman to captain a mail route on the Aphrodite. He is extremely hesitant to have any positive feelings about the experience, from the ship itself, to the inclusion of women on its crew. Not only is this not the type of ship he is used to, he is never served with women on board. He has to navigate adapting to the new situation while adapting to the new job. Through the first week of his assignment, the ship and its crew grow on him. He comes to trust Ivy Hendricks, the Engineering Officer, and he lets her take charge to try to save the other ships when they respond to a distress call. Eventually, she passes out, and has to leave Strike in charge of getting the ships to safety. Eventually,  Strike passes out just like everyone else, from the ship’s acceleration to break the sun’s gravity. At the end of the story, it is clear that his increased appreciation for the ship means he plans on staying, to the delight of his Executive Officer. Cob alludes to Strike having feelings for Ivy, but he says that although she is nice, he has no interest in being with a woman with a higher ranked title than he has. "]}}

He rose and reached for a pressure suit,\nand Tate followed him.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think they'll—\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I\nknow. They're unpredictable.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car\n   \n   whooshed\n   \n  into the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.\n  \n \n  The Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and\nstarted off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\n  \n \n  They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully—a tunnel, now—getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\n  \n \n  The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a\nphosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't\ndecide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.\n  \n \n  \"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He\nswitched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane\non the outside of the helmet. \"\n   \n   Kalis methra\n   \n  ,\" he began haltingly,\n\"\n   \n   seltin guna getal.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not\nenough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\"\n  \n \n  Syme swore amazedly.\n  \n \n  \"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said.

On a planet which is nearly airless on\nits surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to\nignore the obvious.

It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n  \n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters.

The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim—but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings—a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor—the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_4]\nKal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race—the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians—resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians—the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide—very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts—all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough—in their own way—but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_7]\nIt was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n  \n \n  \"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n  \n \n  \"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your—friend—anything you wish to\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\n  \n \n  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why—\" he\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\n  \n \n  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well—how about the Martians—the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n  \n \n  \"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague—and other causes.\n  \n \n  \"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n  \n \n  \"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan—inferior—culture.\"\n  \n \n  \"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  Tate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_1]\nDoorway to Kal-Jmar\n  \n \n  By Stuart Fleming\n  \n \n  Two men had died before Syme Rector's guns\n   \n  to give him the key to the ancient city of\n   \n  Kal-Jmar—a city of untold wealth, and of\n   \n  robots that made desires instant commands.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyes\nimpassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed.\nThen he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape,\nand took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more.\n  \n \n  Above, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from the\ntranslucent Dome—a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which the\nstars shone dimly.\n  \n \n  Getting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now he\nhad another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to pass\nhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,\nafter his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would\nnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he\nhad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet\nPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,\nand concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only\nsafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had\nto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.\n  \n \n  They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw—the very fact of the\ncrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they\ndidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared\nraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.\n  \n \n  He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and\nthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\n  \n \n  The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\n  \n \n  Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n  \n \n  \"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI—\"\n  \n \n  The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then—\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear—but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\n  \n \n  Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\n  \n \n  It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself—that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity—that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\n  \n \n  Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_3]\nSyme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His\nrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy\nhair, a sharp nose, and—oddly conflicting—pale, serious eyes and a\nhumorous wide mouth. He was still panting.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not hurt,\" Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his\ndark, lean face. \"Thanks for giving me a hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"You scared hell out of me,\" said the man. \"I heard a thud. I\nthought—you'd gone over.\" He looked at Syme questioningly.\n  \n \n  \"That was my bag,\" the outlaw said quickly. \"It slipped out of my hand,\nand I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.\"\n  \n \n  The man sighed. \"I need a drink.\n   \n   You\n   \n  need a drink. Come on.\" He\npicked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the\nelevator, then stopped. \"Oh—your bag. Shouldn't we do something about\nthat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind,\" said Syme, taking his arm. \"The shock must have busted it\nwide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.\"\n  \n \n  They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a\ncafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just\nkilled. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on\nthe first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be\nfound until morning.\n  \n \n  And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  , he\ntook it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There\nit was—his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even\nfriendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was\nthe\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  , of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning\nhe'd find a freighter berth—in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there\nwere always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and\nit was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.\n  \n \n  He listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,\ngraceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.\n  \n \n  \"Lissen,\" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,\ncaught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. \"Lissen,\" he\nsaid again, \"I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,\nbut you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,\nbut I hic!—pardon—seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to\ntell you something, because I need your help!—help.\" He paused. \"I\nneed a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG\nplate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting\nin its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their\ndelicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk\nafter them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow\nof\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  inside him.\n  \n \n  \"I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,\" said Tate.\n  \n \n  Syme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,\na hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big\nwas coming—something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.\n\"Why?\" he asked softly. \"Why to Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Harold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,\nhe showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been\nright; it was big.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_2]\nThe tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level\nof the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close\noverhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the\nplatform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred\na touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.\n  \n \n  The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance\naway. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,\ndeadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the\nsilent figure.\n  \n \n  It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by\nsome slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still\nair. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,\ninstinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its\nsilent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a\nminute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.\n  \n \n \n \n  Syme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into\nhis pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms\nand thrust it over the parapet.\n  \n \n  It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.\nBefore he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,\nhe realized what had happened—one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's\nharness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was\nfalling, linked to the body of his victim!\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,\nfelt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His\nbody hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the\ncorpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a\nlittle and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.\n  \n \n  Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into\nplay, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.\nFraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the\nsweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms\nfelt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook\nslipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.\n  \n \n  The reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost\nlost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the\nspaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.\n  \n \n  He swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He\ntried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on\nthe smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold\non for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.\n  \n \n  He heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge\nat him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken\nonly a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\"\n  \n \n  Wordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other\npulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed\nto get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.\n  \n \n  \"Are you all right?\"\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_5]\nSyme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared\nacross their path. \"Gully,\" he announced. \"Shall we cross it, or follow\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Tate peered through the steelite nose of the car. \"Follow, I guess,\"\nhe offered. \"It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we\ncross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.\"\n  \n \n  Syme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he\npressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail\nof the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep\ninto the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike\nwas in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over\nthe edge.\n  \n \n  As the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind\nrevealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire\ncable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical\nincline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides\nas they descended.\n  \n \n  Finally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the\nmetal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground\nagain and the cable reeled in.\n  \n \n  Tate had been watching with interest. \"Very ingenious,\" he said. \"But\nhow do we get up again?\"\n  \n \n  \"Most of these gullies peter out gradually,\" said Syme, \"but if we want\nor have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that\nshoots the anchor up on top.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my\nnatural life. Depressing view.\" He looked up at the narrow strip of\nalmost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his\nhead.\n  \n \n  Neither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their\nharpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and\nthe gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper\nblackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted,\n\"Look out!\" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever.\n  \n \n  The car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the\ngully. Syme was saying, \"What—?\" when there was a thunderous crash\nthat shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into\nthe ground immediately to their left.\n  \n \n  When the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread\nof the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition.\n  \n \n  Syme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate\nsaid, \"I guess we walk from here on.\" Then he looked up again and\ncaught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully\ntoward them.\n  \n \n  \"My God!\" he said. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  Syme looked. \"Those,\" he said bitterly, \"are Martians.\"\n  \n \n  The natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged. Also like all\nMartian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs\nthey did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece—or,\nmore properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large\nas they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge\nthat made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with\na valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the\nbloodstream.\n  \n \n  Their faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the\nlips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black\nfur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of\nwhite were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise;\nor, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which\nhelped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now\nthey were mostly black.\n  \n \n  The natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand\ncar, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears,\nalthough some had the slim Benson energy guns—strictly forbidden to\nMartians.\n  \n \n  Syme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he\nswallowed audibly.\n  \n \n  One Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and\nmotioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and\nthen gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,\ncould burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same\nspot long enough.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_10]\nTate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew—they wouldn't have tried to stop us if—Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field—doors—set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest—as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then—\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  —\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But—he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_8]\nIt was like tangling with a draft horse. The Martian was astonishingly\nstrong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't\ntear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost\nfeel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the\nswift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.\n  \n \n  He put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every\nmuscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with\npower. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's\niron grip!\n  \n \n  He clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the\nweapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped\nhis lance and fell without a sound.\n  \n \n  The next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way\nbarely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and\nswerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of\nthe weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.\n  \n \n  Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the\ntrapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely\nto let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped\nhis body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His\nright leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And\nall the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,\nseeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes,\ndodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of\nhis powerful lungs.\n  \n \n  At last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down\nthe rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped\nthe weapon from blistered fingers.\n  \n \n  He was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from\nthe seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency\nkit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out\na tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing\nit impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the\nburned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid\nformed an airtight patch.\n  \n \n  Only then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind\nhim, his hands empty at his sides. \"I'm sorry,\" Tate said miserably. \"I\ncould have grabbed a spear or something, but—I just couldn't, not even\nto save my own life.

He\nturned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,\nbut with his feral, tigerish head held high.\n  \n \n  He led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed\nhim with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something\nthat shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and\ndidn't know what to do about it.\n  \n \n  Still silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the\nsame, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black\nsuitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around\nto the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which\nmight have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed.

A magic word, even today, isn't it? Lust and gold ... they go\nhand in hand. Like the horsemen of the Apocalypse. And, of course,\nthere's another word needed to make up the trilogy. You don't get\nany thing for nothing. So add this: Cost. Or you might call it pain,\nsorrow, agony. Call it what you like. It's what you pay for great\ntreasure....\n  \n \n  These things were true when fabled Jason sailed the Argo beyond Colchis\nseeking the Fleece. They were true when men sailed the southern oceans\nin wooden ships. And the conquest of space hasn't changed us a bit.\nWe're still a greedy lot....\n  \n \n  I'm a queer one to be saying these things, but then, who has more\nright? Look at me. My hair is gray and my face ... my face is a mask.\nThe flesh hangs on my bones like a yellow cloth on a rickety frame. I\nam old, old. And I wait here on my hospital cot—wait for the weight of\nyears I never lived to drag me under and let me forget the awful things\nmy eyes have seen.\n  \n \n  I'm poor, too, or else I wouldn't be here in this place of dying for\nold spacemen. I haven't a dime except for the pittance the Holcomb\nFoundation calls a spaceman's pension. Yet I had millions in my hands.\nTreasure beyond your wildest dreams! Cursed treasure....\n  \n \n  You smile. You are thinking that I'm just an old man, beached\nearthside, spinning tall tales to impress the youngsters. Maybe,\nthinking about the kind of spacemen my generation produced, you have\nthe idea that if ever we'd so much as laid a hand on anything of value\nout in space we'd not let go until Hell froze over! Well, you're\nright about that. We didn't seek the spaceways for the advancement of\ncivilization or any of that Foundation bushwah, you can be certain of\nthat. We did it for\n   \n   us\n   \n  ... for Number One. That's the kind of men we\nwere, and we were proud of it. We hung onto what we found because the\nrisks were high and we were entitled to keep what we could out there.\nBut there are strange things in the sky. Things that don't respond to\nall of our neat little Laws and Theories. There are things that are no\npart of the world of men, thick with danger—and horror.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_9]\nThey started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n  \n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n  \n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n  \n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n  \n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection—and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n  \n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n  \n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n  \n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n  \n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch.

Rector crashed his ship in the Mare Cimmerium and left a false trail for authorities to divert them from following him to Lillis, where he plans to obtain a spaceman’s identity card. This card will enable him to ship out on a freighter flight after he has obtained his stolen goods. \n\nRector follows a young patrolman until he catches him unaware on the observation deck of the Founders’ Tower. Rector shoots him in the chest, steals his wallet, and throws his body over the parapet. However, a hook on the patrolman’s uniform catches Rector, pulling Rector over the parapet. He manages to unhook himself, and just as he estimates he can hold on one minute longer, a man comes and pulls him up. The man is Harold Tate, and he invites Rector to have a drink with him. As they get drunk, Tate confides to Rector that he needs a guide to take him to Kal-Jmar; he has discovered a way to enter the dome surrounding the city. \n\nThe two men set out on their journey and follow a gully they reach. While they are in the lower part, Tate sees something overhead, and a boulder crashes down just to the left of their sand car. A horde of Martians surrounds them and forces the two men to go with them. The leader reveals that the Martians are telepathic and have no need for a spoken language. The Martians want nothing to do with the humans because there is nothing to gain from the humans. The leader tells the men the history of the two species of Martians but says they will kill the men.\n\nWhen the leader pulls his gun on Tate, Rector launches himself against the leader and wrestles away his gun. He shoots the leader and the other Martians as he dodges their shots. The two men then begin walking toward Kal-Jmar and reach the city. Tate uses his device to create a hole in the dome but realizes it isn’t strong enough. Then he thinks of using it where a door would have been, and it works. Rector shoots Tate, and just before he dies, Tate warns him, “You’ll be--sorry.” Rector takes the device and enters the city, noting all the treasures he can steal. He realizes he is hungry and takes two food tablets, but they don’t satisfy him. Then a lifelike robot that is a feeding machine enters and approaches Rector.

His body falls to the group, just as Harold Tate, physicist, rescues Syme. \nWith his victim’s wallet in hand, Syme takes Tate to the bar and orders drinks for the both of them. Tate drunkenly reveals his greatest invention and desire to go to Kal-Jmar to test it out. Syme agrees to take him to the city, with the hopes of glory and money in return. On their journey across Mars, they run into the native Martians and are captured. These terrifying creatures take them deep down into the caverns, where some oxygen is present. Since the Martians are going to kill them, they are able to reveal some of their secrest. They tell them the story of the downfall of Kal-Jmar, show off their telepathic abilities, and more. Syme is able to escape and kill all the Martians, rescuing Tate who was of no help. \nThey continue their journey, now on foot, even though Syme was injured in the fight. Once they reach Kal-Jmar, Tate sets up his equipment. His first try fails, due to the enormity of the force field. His battery power is limited though, and he only has a few more tries left. He figures out that there must be areas where the force field is weaker, doorways in the dome. Tate locates one and they use his invention on it. It works, and the doorway opens. As they move to enter it, Syme reminds Tate to gather his equipment. As he does this, Syme pulls out his gun and shoots Tate in the chest. He steals his equipment and steps through the rapidly closing doorway. \nNow in the great city of Kal-Jmar, he takes his time and explores.

He immediately sets his eyes on platinum, ornaments, machines, books, and records. In his mind, he makes big plans to steal as much as he can carry and sell it immediately. He will come back for bigger items later. \n\nHe sees a robot rolling silently around the room, and Rector realizes that the robot is there to feed the Martians.

Some were blue and some green and some dun. After\na while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin\ncame to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell\napart as the different oceans.\n  \n \n \n \n  All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in\nhis life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only\nthe young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust\ntheir elders.\n  \n \n  As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest\nin the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port\nfor fuel or supplies—it was more economical to purchase them in that\nera than to have them shipped from the future—he seldom went ashore,\nand then only at the urging of a newly assigned cousin anxious to see\nthe sights. Most of the time Martin spent in watching the sea—and\nsometimes he painted it. There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes\nthat his other work lacked.\n  \n \n  When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit\nsomewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way,\nhe could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this\njourney. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was\npurpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the\ncousin's utter disgust.\n  \n \n  \"Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you\ndo,\" the cousin—who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were\nscraping bottom now—advised.\n  \n \n  Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be\ndisillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither\npurpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored.\nHowever, a museum bought two of the paintings. Martin thought of Ives\nand felt an uncomfortable pang of a sensation he could no longer\nunderstand.\n  \n \n  \"Where do you suppose Conrad has been all this time?\" Martin idly asked\nthe current cousin—who was passing as his nephew by now.\n  \n \n  The young man jumped, then glanced around him uncomfortably. \"Conrad's\na very shrewd fellow,\" he whispered. \"He's biding his time—waiting\nuntil we're off guard. And then—pow!—he'll attack!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I see,\" Martin said.\n  \n \n  He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating\nmember of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would\never have a chance for a conversation with the young man. More than one\nconversation, anyhow.\n  \n \n  \"When he does show up, I'll protect you,\" the cousin vowed, touching\nhis ray gun. \"You haven't a thing to worry about.\"\n  \n \n  Martin smiled with all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire. \"I\nhave every confidence in you,\" he told his descendant. He himself had\ngiven up carrying a gun long ago.\n  \n \n  There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid\nout in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel\nand man and will—to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long\ntime.\n   \n   The Interregnum\n   \n  roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of\npassengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She\nbore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.\n\n[Chapter: The_Beast-Jewel_of_Mars_1]\nThe Beast-Jewel of Mars\n  \n \n  By V. E.

Behind him the\nlittle winds sifted red dust into his collar, but he could not move; he\ncould only sit there with his gaze riveted on the spires and minarets\nthat twinkled in the distance, far down the bottom of the canal.\n  \n \n  One part of his mind said,\n   \n   This is it, this is the fabled city of\nMars. This is the beauty and the fantasy and the music of the legends,\nand I must go down there.\n   \n  Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in\nthe primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and\nurgent.\n   \n   Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the\ncity before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk,\na soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those\nwho came before you.\n   \n \n \n  He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic\nbeauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to\nclose them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open,\nstaring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin\nwail of music reached him, saying,\n   \n   Come into the city, come down into\nthe fabled city\n   \n  .\n  \n \n  He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal.\nThe rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it\ntouched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the\ntowers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.\n  \n \n  His feet caught a projecting bit of stone and were slowed for an\ninstant, so that he turned sideways and rolled on, down into the red\ndust bottom of the canal, to lie face down in the dust, with the chin\nstrap of the odd metallic hat cutting cruelly into his chin.\n  \n \n  He lay there an instant, knowing that now he had a chance. With his\nface down like this, and the dust smarting his eyes the image was gone\nfor an instant. He had to get away, he knew that. He had to mount the\nsides of the canal and never look back.\n  \n \n  He told himself, \"I am Eric North, from Earth, the Third Planet of Sol,\nand this is not real.\"\n  \n \n  He squirmed in the dust, feeling it bite his cheeks; he squirmed until\nhe could get up and see nothing but the red sand stone walls of the\ncanal. He ran at the walls and clawed his way up like an animal in his\nhaste. He wouldn't look again.\n  \n \n  The wind freshened and the tune of the music began to talk to him. It\ntold of going barefoot over long streets of fur. It told of jewels, and\nwine, and women as fair as springtime. These and more were in the city,\nwaiting for him to claim them.\n  \n \n  He sobbed, and clawed forward. He stopped to rest, and slowly his head\nbegan to turn. He turned, and the spires and minarets twinkled at him,\nbeautiful, soothing, stopping the tears that had welled down his cheeks.\n  \n \n  When he reached the bottom of the canal he began to run toward the city.\n  \n \n  When he came to the city there was a high wall around it, and a heavy\ngate carved with lotus blossoms. He beat against the gate and cried,\n\"Oh! Let me in. Let me in to the city!\" The music was richer now, as if\nit were everywhere, and the gate swung open without the faintest sound.\n  \n \n  A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue\nstreet. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue\nleopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew\nthe sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the\nsword touched the street of blue fur. He said, \"I give you the welcome\nof my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it\nmay be set in the records of the dreamers.\"\n  \n \n  The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \"I am Eric\nNorth!\"\n  \n \n  The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was\nwhite. He cried aloud, \"It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\nLegend.\" He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal\nhat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.\n\n[Chapter: A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_2]\nThe native stood in the street less than a hundred feet away, waving\nhis arms madly. \"Mr. Earthgod,\" he cried. \"It is sacred ground where\nyou are trespassing!\"\n  \n \n  The archeologist smiled, watching the man hurry closer. He was short,\neven for a native. Long gray hair hung to his shoulders, bobbing up\nand down as he walked. He wore no shoes. The toes of his webbed feet\ndragged in the sand, making a deep trail behind him. He was an old man.\n  \n \n  \"You never told us about this old dead city,\" Michaelson said,\nchidingly. \"Shame on you. But never mind. I've found it now. Isn't it\nbeautiful?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, beautiful. You will leave now.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave?\" Michaelson asked, acting surprised as if the man were a\nchild. \"I just got here a few hours ago.\"\n  \n \n  \"You must go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why? Who are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am keeper of the city.\"\n  \n \n  \"You?\" Michaelson laughed. Then, seeing how serious the native was,\nsaid, \"What makes you think a dead city needs a keeper?\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits may return.\"\n  \n \n  Michaelson crawled out of the doorway and stood up. He brushed his\ntrousers. He pointed. \"See that wall? Built of some metal, I'd say,\nsome alloy impervious to rust and wear.\"\n  \n \n  \"The spirits are angry.\"\n  \n \n  \"Notice the inscriptions? Wind has blown sand against them for eons,\nand rain and sleet. But their story is there, once we decipher it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Leave!\"\n  \n \n  The native's lined, weathered old face was working around the mouth in\nanger. Michaelson was almost sorry he had mocked him. He was deadly\nserious.\n  \n \n  \"Look,\" he said. \"No spirits are ever coming back here. Don't you know\nthat? And even if they did, spirits care nothing for old cities half\ncovered with sand and dirt.\"\n  \n \n  He walked away from the old man, heading for another building. The\nsun had already gone below the horizon, coloring the high clouds. He\nglanced backward. The webfoot was following.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Earthgod!\" the webfoot cried, so sharply that Michaelson stopped.\n\"You must not touch, not walk upon, not handle. Your step may destroy\nthe home of some ancient spirit. Your breath may cause one iota of\nchange and a spirit may lose his way in the darkness. Go quickly now,\nor be killed.\"\n\n[Chapter: A_CITY_NEAR_CENTAURUS_3]\nHe turned and walked off, not looking back.\n  \n \n  Michaelson stood in the ancient street, tall, gaunt, feet planted wide,\nhands in pockets, watching the webfoot until he was out of sight beyond\na huge circular building. There was a man to watch. There was one of\nthe intelligent ones. One look into the alert old eyes had told him\nthat.\n  \n \n  Michaelson shook his head, and went about satisfying his curiosity.\nHe entered buildings without thought of roofs falling in, or decayed\nfloors dropping from under his weight. He began to collect small items,\nmaking a pile of them in the street. An ancient bowl, metal untouched\nby the ages. A statue of a man, one foot high, correct to the minutest\ndetail, showing how identical they had been to Earthmen. He found books\nstill standing on ancient shelves but was afraid to touch them without\ntools.\n  \n \n  Darkness came swiftly and he was forced out into the street.\n  \n \n  He stood there alone feeling the age of the place.

It is an ancient, perfectly preserved Martian city, but it is inaccessible to outsiders.

This makes it a place of immense mystery and legend.\n\n##begin_quote##\nFor Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected Lillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis as it defied explosives and diamond drills.\n##end_quote##\n\n**Step 4\n\n##Answer: "}], "metadata": {"id": "516", "include_oracle": false, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["The setting of the story is on Mars. It begins in the city of Lillis, which is covered with a translucent steelite dome and is guarded by the Triplanet Patrol. One outstanding feature of the city is its Founders’ Tower, which is the tallest building in Lillis. On the top level, there is an observation deck that looks out over the city. Outside the city is an area called the Mare Cimmerium. The planet has red dust and supports some life, specifically lichens and tumble-grass. It has mountains, canyons, gullies, and deserts.\n\nThe ancient city of Kal-Jmar features prominently in the story. It is an ancient city of the Martian race that was very advanced but is now abandoned. There are machines, records, and other objects left behind, and all are perfectly preserved inside a bubble-like dome that is formed by a force field. Humans have tried to enter the dome using explosives, diamond drills, and even tunnels under the city, but nothing they have tried has penetrated the dome. When Mars was first being conquered, humans tried to get into the city, but their efforts resulted in bloody battles with the current Martians, so eventually, the Mars Protectorate forbade any Earthmen from going near Kal-Jmar. The city has elaborate architecture and features a pair of twin towers. When Rector enters the city, he notices there is no dust, and the air is breathable. Doors open and close automatically. The room Rector enters has platinum ornaments set in the walls and the furniture. \n\nAs Tate and Rector travel toward Kal-Jmar in their sand car outside of Lillis, they note that Mars has a deceptively low horizon. The surface contains a series of dunes, channels, and gullies that they have to cross. The gully they follow is extremely deep and steep, and from the bottom, they can only see a small section of the sky. \n\nWhen the Martians take Tate and Rector to their cavern, it is approximately nine kilometers below the gully they were in. There is a sense of moisture in the tunnel they take to the Martians’ cavern. In the cavern, the walls are covered with a phosphorescent glowing fungus, and there is air, although not enough for the humans to use. Some of the Martians eat the fungus. \n\n", "Although the beginning of the story takes place on Venus, it quickly transitions to Mars. Specifically, the long-lost city of Kal-Jmar. \nWith a protective sphere, Kal-Jmar is impenetrable and the myth and folklore surrounding it are grandiose. Kal-Jmar is only one city on Mars (the last ancient city), where the rest of the Martians live. Many Terrestrials tried to access the city, to view the historic artifacts and glorious treasures, but each attempt only lead to infighting on Mars. Soon, the Mars Protectorate forbade Earthmen to travel on Mars, as well as perform any experiments on Kal-Jmar. \nThis city is rich with well-preserved artifacts and snippets of history that many vyed to get their hands on. This story surrounds the mysteries of this city as well as the desire and need to plunder it.\n", "The story takes place on Mars in the future. The planet has been colonized by humans to the extent that cities such as Lillis are covered with immense domes to protect from the harsh Martian environment.\n\nThe characters in the story head to the ancient Martian domed city of Kal-Jmar. They head across the parched Martian landscape and eventually head down a gully which is filled with moisture and even a phosphorescent type of fungus. Kal-Jmar is filled with treasures but otherwise abandoned.", "The story takes place on Mars. There are parts of Mars that have been colonized by earth men, like the city of Lillis, and parts that the current-day Martians still control. One of those areas is Kal-Jmar, an ancient city that earth men know very little about. When Tate and Rector first come across the city, they immediately notice its fantastic architecture. Although it’s in a state of decay, it’s obvious that the ancient city was once beautiful. \n\nThe dome at Kal-Jmar is particularly fantastic. For many years, earth men have tried to figure out how to break through its forcefield. However, the dome is impervious to bombs, and even diamonds cannot break its shell. Inside the dome are all of the relics of the ancient Martian civilization. Records, machines, books, and precious metals are all hidden away behind its walls. \n\nSeveral thousand years before the story starts, the environment on Mars changed. The ancient Martians were unable to adapt and survive, but the current-day Martians understood the changes they needed to make to survive in the new climate.

The Martian was astonishingly\nstrong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't\ntear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost\nfeel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the\nswift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.\n  \n \n  He put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every\nmuscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with\npower. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's\niron grip!\n  \n \n  He clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the\nweapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped\nhis lance and fell without a sound.\n  \n \n  The next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way\nbarely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and\nswerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of\nthe weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.\n  \n \n  Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the\ntrapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely\nto let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped\nhis body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His\nright leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And\nall the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,\nseeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes,\ndodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of\nhis powerful lungs.\n  \n \n  At last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down\nthe rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped\nthe weapon from blistered fingers.\n  \n \n  He was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from\nthe seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency\nkit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out\na tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing\nit impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the\nburned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid\nformed an airtight patch.\n  \n \n  Only then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind\nhim, his hands empty at his sides. \"I'm sorry,\" Tate said miserably. \"I\ncould have grabbed a spear or something, but—I just couldn't, not even\nto save my own life. I—I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Syme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He\nturned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,\nbut with his feral, tigerish head held high.\n  \n \n  He led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed\nhim with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something\nthat shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and\ndidn't know what to do about it.\n  \n \n  Still silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the\nsame, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black\nsuitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around\nto the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which\nmight have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That\nwas that.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_1]\nDoorway to Kal-Jmar\n  \n \n  By Stuart Fleming\n  \n \n  Two men had died before Syme Rector's guns\n   \n  to give him the key to the ancient city of\n   \n  Kal-Jmar—a city of untold wealth, and of\n   \n  robots that made desires instant commands.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyes\nimpassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed.\nThen he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape,\nand took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more.\n  \n \n  Above, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from the\ntranslucent Dome—a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which the\nstars shone dimly.\n  \n \n  Getting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now he\nhad another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to pass\nhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,\nafter his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would\nnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he\nhad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet\nPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,\nand concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only\nsafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had\nto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.\n  \n \n  They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw—the very fact of the\ncrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they\ndidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared\nraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.\n  \n \n  He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and\nthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\n  \n \n  The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\n  \n \n  Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n  \n \n  \"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI—\"\n  \n \n  The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then—\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear—but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\n  \n \n  Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\n  \n \n  It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself—that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity—that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\n  \n \n  Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_3]\nSyme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His\nrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy\nhair, a sharp nose, and—oddly conflicting—pale, serious eyes and a\nhumorous wide mouth. He was still panting.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not hurt,\" Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his\ndark, lean face. \"Thanks for giving me a hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"You scared hell out of me,\" said the man. \"I heard a thud. I\nthought—you'd gone over.\" He looked at Syme questioningly.\n  \n \n  \"That was my bag,\" the outlaw said quickly. \"It slipped out of my hand,\nand I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.\"\n  \n \n  The man sighed. \"I need a drink.\n   \n   You\n   \n  need a drink. Come on.\" He\npicked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the\nelevator, then stopped. \"Oh—your bag. Shouldn't we do something about\nthat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind,\" said Syme, taking his arm. \"The shock must have busted it\nwide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.\"\n  \n \n  They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a\ncafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just\nkilled. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on\nthe first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be\nfound until morning.\n  \n \n  And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  , he\ntook it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There\nit was—his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even\nfriendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was\nthe\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  , of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning\nhe'd find a freighter berth—in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there\nwere always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and\nit was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.\n  \n \n  He listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,\ngraceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.\n  \n \n  \"Lissen,\" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,\ncaught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. \"Lissen,\" he\nsaid again, \"I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,\nbut you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,\nbut I hic!—pardon—seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to\ntell you something, because I need your help!—help.\" He paused. \"I\nneed a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG\nplate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting\nin its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their\ndelicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk\nafter them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow\nof\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  inside him.\n  \n \n  \"I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,\" said Tate.\n  \n \n  Syme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,\na hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big\nwas coming—something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.\n\"Why?\" he asked softly. \"Why to Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Harold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,\nhe showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been\nright; it was big.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_11]\nThe towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim—but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings—a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor—the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_4]\nKal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race—the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians—resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians—the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide—very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts—all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough—in their own way—but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n\n[Chapter: What_is_POSAT?_1]\nWhat is POSAT? By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction September 1951. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.] Of course coming events cast their shadows before, but this shadow was 400 years long! The following advertisement appeared in the July 1953 issue of several magazines: MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE CAN BE YOURS! What is the secret source of those profound principles that can solve the problems of life? Send for our FREE booklet of explanation. Do not be a leaf in the wind! YOU can alter the course of your life! Tap the treasury of Wisdom through the ages! The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth POSAT an ancient secret society Most readers passed it by with scarcely a glance. It was, after all, similar to the many that had appeared through the years under the name of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes slid over the familiar format of the ad, speculated idly about the persistent and mildly mysterious organization behind it. A few even resolved to clip the attached coupon and send for the booklet—sometime—when a pen or pencil was nearer at hand. Bill Evans, an unemployed pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy of Your Life and Psychology that had been abandoned on his seat in the bus. He filled out the blanks on the coupon with a scrap of stubby pencil. \"You can alter the course of your life!\" he read again. He particularly liked that thought, even though he had long since ceased to believe it. He actually took the trouble to mail the coupon. After all, he had, literally, nothing to lose, and nothing else to occupy his time. Miss Elizabeth Arnable was one of the few to whom the advertisement was unfamiliar. As a matter of fact, she very seldom read a magazine. The radio in her room took the place of reading matter, and she always liked to think that it amused her cats as well as herself. Reading would be so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but what the cats weren't almost smart enough to read, she always said. It just so happened, however, that she had bought a copy of the Antivivisectionist Gazette the day before. She pounced upon the POSAT ad as a trout might snap at a particularly attractive fly. Having filled out the coupon with violet ink, she invented an errand that would take her past the neighborhood post office so that she could post it as soon as possible. Donald Alford, research physicist, came across the POSAT ad tucked at the bottom of a column in The Bulletin of Physical Research . He was engrossed in the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, a man whom he admired from the point of view of both a former student and a fellow research worker. Consequently, he was one of the many who passed over the POSAT ad with the disregard accorded to any common object. He read with interest to the end of the article before he realized that some component of the advertisement had been noted by a region of his brain just beyond consciousness. It teased at him like a tickle that couldn't be scratched until he turned back to the page. It was the symbol or emblem of POSAT, he realized, that had caught his attention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small black circle might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr atom of helium. He smiled with mild skepticism as he read through the printed matter that accompanied it. \"I wonder what their racket is,\" he mused. Then, because his typewriter was conveniently at hand, he carefully tore out the coupon and inserted it in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted lines on the coupon, of course, but he didn't bother to correct it. He addressed an envelope, laid it with other mail to be posted, and promptly forgot all about it. Since he was a methodical man, it was entrusted to the U.S. mail early the next morning, together with his other letters. Three identical forms accompanied the booklet which POSAT sent in response to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more information than had the original advertisement, but with considerable more volubility. It promised the recipient the secrets of the Cosmos and the key that would unlock the hidden knowledge within himself—if he would merely fill out the enclosed form. Bill Evans, the unemployed pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for several days. To be quite honest, he was disappointed. Although he had mentally disclaimed all belief in anything that POSAT might offer, he had watched the return mails with anticipation. His own resources were almost at an end, and he had reached the point where intervention by something supernatural, or at least superhuman, seemed the only hope. He had hoped, unreasonably, that POSAT had an answer. But time lay heavily upon him, and he used it one evening to write the requested information—about his employment (ha!), his religious beliefs, his reason for inquiring about POSAT, his financial situation. Without quite knowing that he did so, he communicated in his terse answers some of his desperation and sense of futility. Miss Arnable was delighted with the opportunity for autobiographical composition. It required five extra sheets of paper to convey all the information that she wished to give—all about her poor, dear father who had been a missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt toward the mystic cults of the East, her belief that her cats were reincarnations of her loved ones (which, she stated, derived from a religion of the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete and absolute acceptance of everything that POSAT had stated in their booklet. And what would the dues be? She wished to join immediately. Fortunately, dear father had left her in a comfortable financial situation. To Donald Alford, the booklet seemed to confirm his suspicion that POSAT was a racket of some sort. Why else would they be interested in his employment or financial position? It also served to increase his curiosity. \"What do you suppose they're driving at?\" he asked his wife Betty, handing her the booklet and questionnaire. \"I don't really know what to say,\" she answered, squinting a little as she usually did when puzzled. \"I know one thing, though, and that's that you won't stop until you find out!\" \"The scientific attitude,\" he acknowledged with a grin. \"Why don't you fill out this questionnaire incognito, though?\" she suggested. \"Pretend that we're wealthy and see if they try to get our money. Do they have anything yet except your name and address?\" Don was shocked. \"If I send this back to them, it will have to be with correct answers!\" \"The scientific attitude again,\" Betty sighed. \"Don't you ever let your imagination run away with the facts a bit? What are you going to give for your reasons for asking about POSAT?\" \"Curiosity,\" he replied, and, pulling his fountain pen from his vest pocket, he wrote exactly that, in small, neat script. It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the contents of the three envelopes that were mailed from the offices of POSAT the following week. For this time they differed. Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that was enclosed gave what apparently meant to be final answers to life's problems. They were couched in vaguely metaphysical terms and offered absolutely no help to him. His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge that he had unexpectedly found a job. Or, rather, it had fallen into his lap. When he had thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a position had been offered him in a wholesale pharmacy in the older industrial part of the city. It was not a particularly attractive place to work, located as it was next to a large warehouse, but to him it was hope for the future. It amused him to discover that the offices of POSAT were located on the other side of the same warehouse, at the end of a blind alley. Blind alley indeed! He felt vaguely ashamed for having placed any confidence in them. Miss Arnable was thrilled to discover that her envelope contained not only several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles rapidly and found that one of them concerned the sacred cats of ancient Egypt), but that it contained also a small pin with the symbol of POSAT wrought in gold and black enamel. The covering letter said that she had been accepted as an active member of POSAT and that the dues were five dollars per month; please remit by return mail. She wrote a check immediately, and settled contentedly into a chair to peruse the article on sacred cats. After a while she\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_9]\nThey started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n  \n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n  \n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n  \n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n  \n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection—and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n  \n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n  \n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n  \n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n  \n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n  \n \n  Nothing happened.\n  \n \n  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_12]\nHe stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory—and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n  \n \n  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n  \n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n  \n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n  \n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n  \n \n  Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_7]\nIt was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n  \n \n  \"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n  \n \n  \"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your—friend—anything you wish to\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\n  \n \n  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why—\" he\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\n  \n \n  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well—how about the Martians—the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n  \n \n  \"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague—and other causes.\n  \n \n  \"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n  \n \n  \"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan—inferior—culture.\"\n  \n \n  \"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  Tate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_6]\n\"Come on,\" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,\nand Tate followed him.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think they'll—\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I\nknow. They're unpredictable.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car\n   \n   whooshed\n   \n  into the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.\n  \n \n  The Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and\nstarted off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\n  \n \n  They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully—a tunnel, now—getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\n  \n \n  The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a\nphosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't\ndecide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.\n  \n \n  \"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He\nswitched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane\non the outside of the helmet. \"\n   \n   Kalis methra\n   \n  ,\" he began haltingly,\n\"\n   \n   seltin guna getal.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not\nenough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\"\n  \n \n  Syme swore amazedly.\n  \n \n  \"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said. Syme\nignored him.\n  \n \n  \"We had our reasons for not doing so,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  \"But how—?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on\nits surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to\nignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for\nseveral thousand years.\"\n  \n \n  He darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face\nwas expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. \"Yes, you're\nright,\" he said. \"The language you and your fellows struggled to learn\nis a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.\"\n  \n \n  Tate looked interested. \"But why this—this gigantic masquerade?\"\n  \n \n  \"You had nothing to give us,\" the Martian said simply.\n  \n \n  Tate frowned, then flushed. \"You mean you avoided revealing yourselves\nbecause you—had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Tate thought again. \"But—\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" the Martian interrupted him, \"revealing the extent of our\ncivilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours\nis an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you\nthought you were taking it from equals or not.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Syme broke in impatiently. \"What do you want with\nus?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian looked at him appraisingly. \"You already suspect.\nUnfortunately, you must die.\"\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_2]\nThe tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level\nof the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close\noverhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the\nplatform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred\na touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.\n  \n \n  The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance\naway. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,\ndeadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the\nsilent figure.\n  \n \n  It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by\nsome slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still\nair. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,\ninstinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its\nsilent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a\nminute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.\n  \n \n \n \n  Syme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into\nhis pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms\nand thrust it over the parapet.\n  \n \n  It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.\nBefore he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,\nhe realized what had happened—one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's\nharness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was\nfalling, linked to the body of his victim!\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,\nfelt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His\nbody hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the\ncorpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a\nlittle and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.\n  \n \n  Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into\nplay, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.\nFraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the\nsweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms\nfelt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook\nslipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.\n  \n \n  The reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost\nlost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the\nspaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.\n  \n \n  He swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He\ntried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on\nthe smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold\non for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.\n  \n \n  He heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge\nat him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken\nonly a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\"\n  \n \n  Wordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other\npulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed\nto get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.\n  \n \n  \"Are you all right?\"\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_5]\nSyme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared\nacross their path. \"Gully,\" he announced. \"Shall we cross it, or follow\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Tate peered through the steelite nose of the car. \"Follow, I guess,\"\nhe offered. \"It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we\ncross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.\"\n  \n \n  Syme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he\npressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail\nof the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep\ninto the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike\nwas in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over\nthe edge.\n  \n \n  As the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind\nrevealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire\ncable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical\nincline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides\nas they descended.\n  \n \n  Finally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the\nmetal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground\nagain and the cable reeled in.\n  \n \n  Tate had been watching with interest. \"Very ingenious,\" he said. \"But\nhow do we get up again?\"\n  \n \n  \"Most of these gullies peter out gradually,\" said Syme, \"but if we want\nor have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that\nshoots the anchor up on top.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my\nnatural life. Depressing view.\" He looked up at the narrow strip of\nalmost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his\nhead.\n  \n \n  Neither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their\nharpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and\nthe gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper\nblackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted,\n\"Look out!\" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever.\n  \n \n  The car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the\ngully. Syme was saying, \"What—?\" when there was a thunderous crash\nthat shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into\nthe ground immediately to their left.\n  \n \n  When the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread\nof the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition.\n  \n \n  Syme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate\nsaid, \"I guess we walk from here on.\" Then he looked up again and\ncaught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully\ntoward them.\n  \n \n  \"My God!\" he said. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  Syme looked. \"Those,\" he said bitterly, \"are Martians.\"\n  \n \n  The natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged. Also like all\nMartian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs\nthey did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece—or,\nmore properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large\nas they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge\nthat made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with\na valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the\nbloodstream.\n  \n \n  Their faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the\nlips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black\nfur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of\nwhite were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise;\nor, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which\nhelped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now\nthey were mostly black.\n  \n \n  The natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand\ncar, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears,\nalthough some had the slim Benson energy guns—strictly forbidden to\nMartians.\n  \n \n  Syme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he\nswallowed audibly.\n  \n \n  One Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and\nmotioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and\nthen gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,\ncould burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same\nspot long enough.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_10]\nTate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew—they wouldn't have tried to stop us if—Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field—doors—set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest—as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then—\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  —\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But—he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a step-by-step reasoning to answer your question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Harold Tate and his purpose.**\nHarold Tate is a physicist who has discovered a method to breach the impenetrable force field surrounding the ancient Martian city of Kal-Jmar.

It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race—the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n  \n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n  \n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n  \n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians—resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians—the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n  \n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n  \n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n  \n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n  \n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide—very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n  \n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts—all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough—in their own way—but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\n   \n   their\n   \n  crazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n  \n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n  \n \n  \"They\n   \n   might\n   \n  do anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n  \n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_6]\n\"Come on,\" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,\nand Tate followed him.\n  \n \n  \"What do you think they'll—\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I\nknow. They're unpredictable.\"\n  \n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car\n   \n   whooshed\n   \n  into the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.\n  \n \n  The Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and\nstarted off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\n  \n \n  They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully—a tunnel, now—getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\n  \n \n  The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a\nphosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't\ndecide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.\n  \n \n  \"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He\nswitched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane\non the outside of the helmet. \"\n   \n   Kalis methra\n   \n  ,\" he began haltingly,\n\"\n   \n   seltin guna getal.\n   \n  \"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not\nenough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\"\n  \n \n  Syme swore amazedly.\n  \n \n  \"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said. Syme\nignored him.\n  \n \n  \"We had our reasons for not doing so,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  \"But how—?\"\n  \n \n  \"We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on\nits surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to\nignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for\nseveral thousand years.\"\n  \n \n  He darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face\nwas expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. \"Yes, you're\nright,\" he said. \"The language you and your fellows struggled to learn\nis a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.\"\n  \n \n  Tate looked interested. \"But why this—this gigantic masquerade?\"\n  \n \n  \"You had nothing to give us,\" the Martian said simply.\n  \n \n  Tate frowned, then flushed. \"You mean you avoided revealing yourselves\nbecause you—had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes.\"\n  \n \n  Tate thought again. \"But—\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" the Martian interrupted him, \"revealing the extent of our\ncivilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours\nis an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you\nthought you were taking it from equals or not.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Syme broke in impatiently. \"What do you want with\nus?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian looked at him appraisingly. \"You already suspect.\nUnfortunately, you must die.\"\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_3]\nSyme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His\nrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy\nhair, a sharp nose, and—oddly conflicting—pale, serious eyes and a\nhumorous wide mouth. He was still panting.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not hurt,\" Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his\ndark, lean face. \"Thanks for giving me a hand.\"\n  \n \n  \"You scared hell out of me,\" said the man. \"I heard a thud. I\nthought—you'd gone over.\" He looked at Syme questioningly.\n  \n \n  \"That was my bag,\" the outlaw said quickly. \"It slipped out of my hand,\nand I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.\"\n  \n \n  The man sighed. \"I need a drink.\n   \n   You\n   \n  need a drink. Come on.\" He\npicked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the\nelevator, then stopped. \"Oh—your bag. Shouldn't we do something about\nthat?\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind,\" said Syme, taking his arm. \"The shock must have busted it\nwide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.\"\n  \n \n  They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a\ncafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just\nkilled. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on\nthe first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be\nfound until morning.\n  \n \n  And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  , he\ntook it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There\nit was—his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even\nfriendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was\nthe\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  , of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning\nhe'd find a freighter berth—in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there\nwere always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and\nit was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.\n  \n \n  He listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,\ngraceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.\n  \n \n  \"Lissen,\" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,\ncaught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. \"Lissen,\" he\nsaid again, \"I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,\nbut you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,\nbut I hic!—pardon—seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to\ntell you something, because I need your help!—help.\" He paused. \"I\nneed a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure,\" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG\nplate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting\nin its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their\ndelicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk\nafter them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow\nof\n   \n   culcha\n   \n  inside him.\n  \n \n  \"I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,\" said Tate.\n  \n \n  Syme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,\na hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big\nwas coming—something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.\n\"Why?\" he asked softly. \"Why to Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Harold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,\nhe showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been\nright; it was big.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_2]\nThe tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level\nof the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close\noverhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the\nplatform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred\na touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.\n  \n \n  The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance\naway. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,\ndeadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the\nsilent figure.\n  \n \n  It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by\nsome slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still\nair. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,\ninstinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its\nsilent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a\nminute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.\n  \n \n \n \n  Syme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into\nhis pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms\nand thrust it over the parapet.\n  \n \n  It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.\nBefore he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,\nhe realized what had happened—one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's\nharness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was\nfalling, linked to the body of his victim!\n  \n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,\nfelt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His\nbody hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the\ncorpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a\nlittle and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.\n  \n \n  Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into\nplay, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.\nFraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the\nsweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms\nfelt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook\nslipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.\n  \n \n  The reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost\nlost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the\nspaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.\n  \n \n  He swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He\ntried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on\nthe smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold\non for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.\n  \n \n  He heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge\nat him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken\nonly a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\"\n  \n \n  Wordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other\npulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed\nto get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.\n  \n \n  \"Are you all right?\"\n\n[Chapter: UNBORN_TOMORROW_2]\nThere was a knock.\n  \n \n  Betty bounced up with Olympic\nagility and had the door swinging\nwide before the knocking was quite\ncompleted.\n  \n \n  He was old, little and had bug\neyes behind pince-nez glasses. His\nsuit was cut in the style of yesteryear\nbut when a suit costs two or\nthree hundred dollars you still retain\ncaste whatever the styling.\n  \n \n  Simon said unenthusiastically,\n\"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated\nthe client's chair. \"Sit down,\nsir.\"\n  \n \n  The client fussed himself with\nBetty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed\nSimon, said finally, \"You know\nmy name, that's pretty good. Never\nsaw you before in my life. Stop fussing\nwith me, young lady. Your ad\nin the phone book says you'll investigate\nanything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only\none exception.\"\n  \n \n  \"Excellent. Do you believe in time\ntravel?\"\n  \n \n  Simon said nothing. Across the\nroom, where she had resumed her\nseat, Betty cleared her throat. When\nSimon continued to say nothing she\nventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, why?\"\n  \n \n  Betty looked to her boss for assistance.\nNone was forthcoming. There\nought to be some very quick, positive,\ndefinite answer. She said, \"Well,\nfor one thing, paradox. Suppose you\nhad a time machine and traveled back\na hundred years or so and killed your\nown great-grandfather. Then how\ncould you ever be born?\"\n  \n \n  \"Confound it if I know,\" the little\nfellow growled. \"How?\"\n  \n \n  Simon said, \"Let's get to the point,\nwhat you wanted to see me about.\"\n  \n \n  \"I want to hire you to hunt me up\nsome time travelers,\" the old boy\nsaid.\n  \n \n  Betty was too far in now to maintain\nher proper role of silent secretary.\n\"Time travelers,\" she said, not\nvery intelligently.\n  \n \n  The potential client sat more erect,\nobviously with intent to hold the\nfloor for a time. He removed the\npince-nez glasses and pointed them\nat Betty. He said, \"Have you read\nmuch science fiction, Miss?\"\n  \n \n  \"Some,\" Betty admitted.\n  \n \n  \"Then you'll realize that there are\na dozen explanations of the paradoxes\nof time travel. Every writer in\nthe field worth his salt has explained\nthem away. But to get on. It's my\ncontention that within a century or\nso man will have solved the problems\nof immortality and eternal youth, and\nit's also my suspicion that he will\neventually be able to travel in time.\nSo convinced am I of these possibilities\nthat I am willing to gamble a\nportion of my fortune to investigate\nthe presence in our era of such time\ntravelers.\"\n  \n \n  Simon seemed incapable of carrying\nthe ball this morning, so Betty\nsaid, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the\nfuture has developed time travel why\ndon't we ever meet such travelers?\"\n  \n \n  Simon put in a word. \"The usual\nexplanation, Betty, is that they can't\nafford to allow the space-time continuum\ntrack to be altered. If, say, a\ntime traveler returned to a period of\ntwenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,\nthen all subsequent history would be\nchanged. In that case, the time traveler\nhimself might never be born. They\nhave to tread mighty carefully.\"\n  \n \n  Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't\nexpect you to be so well informed\non the subject, young man.\"\n  \n \n  Simon shrugged and fumbled\nagain with the aspirin bottle.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_11]\nThe towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n  \n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\n   \n   The city was his!\n   \n \n \n  There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\n  \n \n \n   It was his!\n   \n \n \n  The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n  \n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim—but it was good air, excellent air!\n  \n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings—a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor—the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n  \n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_8]\nIt was like tangling with a draft horse. The Martian was astonishingly\nstrong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't\ntear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost\nfeel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the\nswift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.\n  \n \n  He put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every\nmuscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with\npower. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's\niron grip!\n  \n \n  He clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the\nweapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped\nhis lance and fell without a sound.\n  \n \n  The next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way\nbarely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and\nswerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of\nthe weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.\n  \n \n  Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the\ntrapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely\nto let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped\nhis body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His\nright leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And\nall the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,\nseeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes,\ndodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of\nhis powerful lungs.\n  \n \n  At last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down\nthe rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped\nthe weapon from blistered fingers.\n  \n \n  He was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from\nthe seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency\nkit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out\na tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing\nit impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the\nburned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid\nformed an airtight patch.\n  \n \n  Only then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind\nhim, his hands empty at his sides. \"I'm sorry,\" Tate said miserably. \"I\ncould have grabbed a spear or something, but—I just couldn't, not even\nto save my own life. I—I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.\"\n  \n \n  Syme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He\nturned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,\nbut with his feral, tigerish head held high.\n  \n \n  He led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed\nhim with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something\nthat shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and\ndidn't know what to do about it.\n  \n \n  Still silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the\nsame, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black\nsuitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around\nto the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which\nmight have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That\nwas that.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_12]\nHe stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory—and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n  \n \n  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n  \n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n  \n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  fungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n  \n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof\n   \n   xopa\n   \n  -juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n  \n \n  Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_9]\nThey started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n  \n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n  \n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n  \n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n  \n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n  \n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection—and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n  \n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n  \n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n  \n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n  \n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n  \n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n  \n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n  \n \n  Nothing happened.\n  \n \n  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_10]\nTate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n  \n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew—they wouldn't have tried to stop us if—Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n  \n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field—doors—set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n  \n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n  \n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest—as\ngood as any other.\"\n  \n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n  \n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then—\n  \n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n  \n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n  \n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n  \n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n  \n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n  \n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n  \n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n  \n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n  \n \n  \"\n   \n   You'll be\n   \n  —\n   \n   sorry\n   \n  ,\" Tate said, and died.\n  \n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But—he'd be sorry!\n  \n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n  \n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_1]\nDoorway to Kal-Jmar\n  \n \n  By Stuart Fleming\n  \n \n  Two men had died before Syme Rector's guns\n   \n  to give him the key to the ancient city of\n   \n  Kal-Jmar—a city of untold wealth, and of\n   \n  robots that made desires instant commands.\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Planet Stories Winter 1944.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyes\nimpassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed.\nThen he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape,\nand took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more.\n  \n \n  Above, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from the\ntranslucent Dome—a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which the\nstars shone dimly.\n  \n \n  Getting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now he\nhad another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to pass\nhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,\nafter his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would\nnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he\nhad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet\nPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,\nand concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only\nsafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had\nto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.\n  \n \n  They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw—the very fact of the\ncrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they\ndidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared\nraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.\n  \n \n  He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and\nthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\n  \n \n  The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\n  \n \n  Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n  \n \n  \"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI—\"\n  \n \n  The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then—\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear—but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\n  \n \n  Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\n  \n \n  It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself—that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity—that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\n  \n \n  Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_5]\nSyme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared\nacross their path. \"Gully,\" he announced. \"Shall we cross it, or follow\nit?\"\n  \n \n  Tate peered through the steelite nose of the car. \"Follow, I guess,\"\nhe offered. \"It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we\ncross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.\"\n  \n \n  Syme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he\npressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail\nof the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep\ninto the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike\nwas in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over\nthe edge.\n  \n \n  As the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind\nrevealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire\ncable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical\nincline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides\nas they descended.\n  \n \n  Finally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the\nmetal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground\nagain and the cable reeled in.\n  \n \n  Tate had been watching with interest. \"Very ingenious,\" he said. \"But\nhow do we get up again?\"\n  \n \n  \"Most of these gullies peter out gradually,\" said Syme, \"but if we want\nor have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that\nshoots the anchor up on top.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my\nnatural life. Depressing view.\" He looked up at the narrow strip of\nalmost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his\nhead.\n  \n \n  Neither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their\nharpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and\nthe gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper\nblackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted,\n\"Look out!\" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever.\n  \n \n  The car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the\ngully. Syme was saying, \"What—?\" when there was a thunderous crash\nthat shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into\nthe ground immediately to their left.\n  \n \n  When the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread\nof the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition.\n  \n \n  Syme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate\nsaid, \"I guess we walk from here on.\" Then he looked up again and\ncaught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully\ntoward them.\n  \n \n  \"My God!\" he said. \"What are those?\"\n  \n \n  Syme looked. \"Those,\" he said bitterly, \"are Martians.\"\n  \n \n  The natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged. Also like all\nMartian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs\nthey did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece—or,\nmore properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large\nas they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge\nthat made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with\na valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the\nbloodstream.\n  \n \n  Their faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the\nlips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black\nfur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of\nwhite were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise;\nor, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which\nhelped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now\nthey were mostly black.\n  \n \n  The natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand\ncar, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears,\nalthough some had the slim Benson energy guns—strictly forbidden to\nMartians.\n  \n \n  Syme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he\nswallowed audibly.\n  \n \n  One Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and\nmotioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and\nthen gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,\ncould burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same\nspot long enough.\n\n[Chapter: Doorway_to_Kal-Jmar_7]\nIt was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n  \n \n  \"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n  \n \n  \"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your—friend—anything you wish to\nknow.\"\n  \n \n  Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\n  \n \n  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why—\" he\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n  \n \n  \"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\n  \n \n  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well—how about the Martians—the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n  \n \n  \"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n  \n \n  \"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague—and other causes.\n  \n \n  \"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n  \n \n  \"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan—inferior—culture.\"\n  \n \n  \"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\n  \n \n  Tate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\n  \n \n  The Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\n  \n \n  Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian.\n\nPlease provide your reasoning with exact quotes from the relevant chapters, then give your final answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a step-by-step reasoning of the items Syme Rector uses for survival during his quest:\n\n**Step 1: Energy Pistol**\nSyme Rector consistently relies on his \"slim, deadly energy pistol\" to eliminate threats and achieve his objectives.

He has harpoon guns that he and Tate can use later if they need to climb back out of the gully. After Rector battles with the Martians and shoots them, he uses a tube of sealing liquid that he carries in his emergency kit to seal the tear in his suit so that he stops losing oxygen. He also uses the sealant to close the wound in his leg from the graze of one of the Benson guns the Martians fired at him.

It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n  \n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n  \n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears—or no ears at all—but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n  \n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n  \n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n  \n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n  \n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry.

He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n  \n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit—\"\n  \n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n  \n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n  \n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n  \n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n  \n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n  \n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n  \n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n  \n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_2]\nThe mail pilot, a leathery veteran with quarter-inch whiskers, spat\ntoward a stained corner of the compartment, leaned close to the screen.\n  \n \n  \"They's shootin' goin' on down there,\" he said. \"See them white puffs\nover the edge of the desert?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm supposed to be preventing the war,\" said Retief. \"It looks like\nI'm a little late.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot's head snapped around. \"War?\" he yelped. \"Nobody told me they\nwas a war goin' on on 'Dobe. If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out of\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.\"\n  \n \n  \"They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance.\" He started\npunching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief\nblocked casually. \"Are you nuts?\" the pilot screeched. \"They's plenty\nshootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.\"\n  \n \n  \"The mail must go through, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'll\ntell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a pal. I'll take your offer.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot jumped to the lifeboat hatch and cycled it open. \"Get in.\nWe're closin' fast. Them birds might take it into their heads to lob\none this way....\"\n  \n \n  Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over the\ncontrols. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a\nheavy old-fashioned power pistol. \"Long as you're goin' in, might as\nwell take this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks.\" Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. \"I hope you're wrong.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over—one way or another.\"\n  \n \n  The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiff\ndropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the\ndeparting mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the\nmanual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....\n  \n \n  A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.\n  \n \n  Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy\nradiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed\nbut by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a\nhigh trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....\n  \n \n  Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.\n  \n \n  He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This\nwas going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief\nthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the\noncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,\ncorrecting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no\nmore than 1000 yards.\n  \n \n  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past\nthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining\nharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and\nharmless.\n  \n \n  Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.\nRetief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on\nits back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series of\nshocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by the\nping of hot metal contracting.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_5]\nFive minutes' stealthy progress brought him to a slight rise of ground.\nWith infinite caution he raised himself, risking a glance over an\nout-cropping of rock.\n  \n \n  The stunted trees ended just ahead. Beyond, he could make out the dim\ncontour of rolling desert. Flap-jack country. He got to his feet,\nclambered over the stone—still hot after a day of tropical heat—and\nmoved forward twenty yards. Around him he saw nothing but drifted sand,\npalely visible in the starlight, and the occasional shadow of jutting\nshale slabs. Behind him the jungle was still.\n  \n \n  He sat down on the ground to wait.\n  \n \n  It was ten minutes before a movement caught his eye. Something had\nseparated itself from a dark mass of stone, glided across a few yards\nof open ground to another shelter. Retief watched. Minutes passed. The\nshape moved again, slipped into a shadow ten feet distant. Retief felt\nthe butt of the power pistol with his elbow. His guess had better be\nright this time....\n  \n \n  There was a sudden rasp, like leather against concrete, and a flurry of\nsand as the Flap-jack charged.\n  \n \n  Retief rolled aside, then lunged, threw his weight on the flopping\nFlap-jack—a yard square, three inches thick at the center and all\nmuscle. The ray-like creature heaved up, curled backward, its edge\nrippling, to stand on the flattened rim of its encircling sphincter.\nIt scrabbled with prehensile fringe-tentacles for a grip on Retief's\nshoulders. He wrapped his arms around the alien and struggled to his\nfeet. The thing was heavy. A hundred pounds at least. Fighting as it\nwas, it seemed more like five hundred.\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack reversed its tactics, went limp. Retief grabbed, felt a\nthumb slip into an orifice—\n  \n \n  The alien went wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, fellow,\" he muttered between clenched teeth. \"Eye-gouging isn't\ngentlemanly, but it's effective....\"\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack fell still, only its fringes rippling slowly. Retief\nrelaxed the pressure of his thumb; the alien gave a tentative jerk; the\nthumb dug in.\n  \n \n  The alien went limp again, waiting.\n  \n \n  \"Now we understand each other,\" said Retief. \"Take me to your leader.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_4]\nRetief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain—\"\n  \n \n  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n  \n \n  \"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\n  \n \n  Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n  \n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n  \n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire—\n  \n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n  \n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_7]\nA scratchy sound issued from the disk. \"Pardon my laughter,\" Hoshick\nsaid, \"but surely you jest?\"\n  \n \n  \"As a matter of fact,\" said Retief, \"we ourselves seldom use weapons.\"\n  \n \n  \"I seem to recall that our first contact of skirmishforms involved the\nuse of a weapon by one of your units.\"\n  \n \n  \"My apologies,\" said Retief. \"The—ah—the skirmishform failed to\nrecognize that he was dealing with a sportsman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Still, now that we have commenced so merrily with weapons....\" Hoshick\nsignaled and the servant refilled tubes.\n  \n \n  \"There is an aspect I haven't yet mentioned,\" Retief went on. \"I hope\nyou won't take this personally, but the fact is, our skirmishforms\nthink of weapons as something one employs only in dealing with certain\nspecific life-forms.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Curious. What forms are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, but\nlacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of such\nworthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you to\npoint it out.\" Hoshick clucked in dismay. \"I see that skirmishforms are\nmuch the same among you as with us: lacking in perception.\" He laughed\nscratchily. \"Imagine considering us as—what was the word?—varmints.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up against\na serious problem with regard to skirmishforms. A low birth rate.\nTherefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actions\nso dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end to\nthese contests altogether....\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air.\n\"What are you saying?\" he gasped. \"Are you proposing that Hoshick of\nthe Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir!\" said Retief sternly. \"You forget yourself. I, Retief of the Red\nTape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with the\nnewest sporting principles.\"\n  \n \n  \"New?\" cried Hoshick. \"My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'm\nenthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and the\ntwo individuals settle the issue between them.\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... um ... fear I don't understand. What possible significance could\none attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't made myself clear,\" said Retief. He took a sip of wine. \"We\ndon't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean...?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. You and me.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_10]\nConsul Passwyn glanced up at Retief, went on perusing a paper.\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Retief,\" he said absently. \"I thought you were over on\nPueblo, or Mud-flat, or whatever they call that desert.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm back.\"\n  \n \n  Passwyn eyed him sharply. \"Well, well, what is it you need, man? Speak\nup. Don't expect me to request any military assistance, no matter how\nthings are....\"\n  \n \n  Retief passed a bundle of documents across the desk. \"Here's the\nTreaty. And a Mutual Assistance Pact declaration and a trade agreement.\"\n  \n \n  \"Eh?\" Passwyn picked up the papers, riffled through them. He leaned\nback in his chair, beamed.\n  \n \n  \"Well, Retief. Expeditiously handled.\" He stopped, blinked at Retief.\n\"You seem to have a bruise on your jaw. I hope you've been conducting\nyourself as befits a member of the Embassy staff.\"\n  \n \n  \"I attended a sporting event,\" Retief said. \"One of the players got a\nlittle excited.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well ... it's one of the hazards of the profession. One must\npretend an interest in such matters.\" Passwyn rose, extended a hand.\n\"You've done well, my boy. Let this teach you the value of following\ninstructions to the letter.\"\n  \n \n  Outside, by the hall incinerator drop, Retief paused long enough to\ntake from his briefcase a large buff envelope, still sealed, and drop\nit in the slot.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_9]\nThere were.\n  \n \n  Retief dug in and the Flap-jack writhed, pulled away. Retief held on,\nscrambled to his feet, threw his weight against the alien and fell on\ntop of him, still gouging. Hoshick rippled his fringe wildly, flopped\nin terror, then went limp.\n  \n \n  Retief relaxed, released his hold and got to his feet, breathing hard.\nHoshick humped himself over onto his ventral side, lifted and moved\ngingerly over to the sidelines. His retainers came forward, assisted\nhim into his trappings, strapped on the translator. He sighed heavily,\nadjusted the volume.\n  \n \n  \"There is much to be said for the old system,\" he said. \"What a burden\none's sportsmanship places on one at times.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great sport, wasn't it?\" said Retief. \"Now, I know you'll be eager to\ncontinue. If you'll just wait while I run back and fetch some of our\ngougerforms—\"\n  \n \n  \"May hide-ticks devour the gougerforms!\" Hoshick bellowed. \"You've\ngiven me such a sprong-ache as I'll remember each spawning-time for a\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speaking of hide-ticks,\" said Retief, \"we've developed a biterform—\"\n  \n \n  \"Enough!\" Hoshick roared, so loudly that the translator bounced on his\nhide. \"Suddenly I yearn for the crowded yellow sands of Jaq. I had\nhoped....\" He broke off, drew a rasping breath. \"I had hoped, Retief,\"\nhe said, speaking sadly now, \"to find a new land here where I might\nplan my own Mosaic, till these alien sands and bring forth such a crop\nof paradise-lichen as should glut the markets of a hundred worlds. But\nmy spirit is not equal to the prospect of biterforms and gougerforms\nwithout end. I am shamed before you....\"\n  \n \n  \"To tell you the truth, I'm old-fashioned myself. I'd rather watch the\naction from a distance too.\"\n  \n \n  \"But surely your spawn-fellows would never condone such an attitude.\"\n  \n \n  \"My spawn-fellows aren't here. And besides, didn't I mention it? No\none who's really in the know would think of engaging in competition by\nmere combat if there were any other way. Now, you mentioned tilling the\nsand, raising lichens—things like that—\"\n  \n \n  \"That on which we dined but now,\" said Hoshick, \"and from which the\nwine is made.\"\n  \n \n  \"The big news in fashionable diplomacy today is farming competition.\nNow, if you'd like to take these deserts and raise lichen, we'll\npromise to stick to the oases and vegetables.\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick curled his back in attention. \"Retief, you're quite serious?\nYou would leave all the fair sand hills to us?\"\n  \n \n  \"The whole works, Hoshick. I'll take the oases.\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick rippled his fringes ecstatically. \"Once again you have outdone\nme, Retief,\" he cried. \"This time, in generosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll talk over the details later. I'm sure we can establish a set of\nrules that will satisfy all parties. Now I've got to get back. I think\nsome of the gougerforms are waiting to see me.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  It was nearly dawn when Retief gave the whistled signal he had agreed\non with Potter, then rose and walked into the camp circle. Swazey stood\nup.\n  \n \n  \"There you are,\" he said. \"We been wonderin' whether to go out after\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel came forward, one eye black to the cheekbone. He held out a\nraw-boned hand. \"Sorry I jumped you, stranger. Tell you the truth, I\nthought you was some kind of stool-pigeon from the CDT.\"\n  \n \n  Bert came up behind Lemuel. \"How do you know he ain't, Lemuel?\" he\nsaid. \"Maybe he—\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel floored Bert with a backward sweep of his arm. \"Next\ncotton-picker says some embassy Johnny can cool me gets worse'n that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell me,\" said Retief. \"How are you boys fixed for wine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wine? Mister, we been livin' on stump water for a year now. 'Dobe's\nfatal to the kind of bacteria it takes to ferment likker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Try this.\" Retief handed over a sqat jug. Swazey drew the cork,\nsniffed, drank and passed it to Lemuel.\n  \n \n  \"Mister, where'd you get that?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Flap-jacks make it. Here's another question for you: Would you\nconcede a share in this planet to the Flap-jacks in return for a peace\nguarantee?\"\n  \n \n  At the end of a half hour of heated debate Lemuel turned to Retief.\n\"We'll make any reasonable deal,\" he said. \"I guess they got as much\nright here as we have. I think we'd agree to a fifty-fifty split.\nThat'd give about a hundred and fifty oases to each side.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you say to keeping all the oases and giving them the\ndesert?\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel reached for the wine jug, eyes on Retief. \"Keep talkin',\nmister,\" he said. \"I think you got yourself a deal.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_1]\nRETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  by KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Retief knew the importance of sealed\n   \n  orders—and the need to keep them that way!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"It's true,\" Consul Passwyn said, \"I requested assignment as principal\nofficer at a small post.

Marvelous experience.\"\n  \n \n  He turned to the wall-screen and pressed a button. A system triagram\nappeared: eight luminous green dots arranged around a larger disk\nrepresenting the primary. He picked up a pointer, indicating the\ninnermost planet.\n  \n \n  \"The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers—a\nmere handful of them—have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble with\nan intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq.

However I\nhave, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters to\ntake certain action.\" He swung back to face Retief. \"I'm sending you\nin to handle the situation, Retief—under sealed orders.\" He picked\nup a fat buff envelope. \"A pity they didn't see fit to order the\nTerrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late.\nI'm expected to produce a miracle—a rapprochement between Terrestrial\nand Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic. However, failure\nwould look very bad in my record, so I shall expect results.\"\n  \n \n  He passed the buff envelope across to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"I understood that Adobe was uninhabited,\" Retief said, \"until the\nTerrestrial settlers arrived.\"\n  \n \n  \"Apparently, that was an erroneous impression.\" Passwyn fixed Retief\nwith a watery eye. \"You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In a\ndelicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptu\nelement introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail at\nSector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?\"\n  \n \n  \"Has anyone at Headquarters ever visited Adobe?\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course not. They all hate travel. If there are no other questions,\nyou'd best be on your way.

He beat\nout sparks in his lap, groped underfoot for the hatch and wrenched it\nopen. A wave of hot jungle air struck him. He lowered himself to a bed\nof shattered foliage, got to his feet ... and dropped flat as a bullet\nwhined past his ear.\n  \n \n  He lay listening. Stealthy movements were audible from the left.\n  \n \n  He inched his way to the shelter of a broad-boled dwarf tree. Somewhere\na song lizard burbled. Whining insects circled, scented alien life,\nbuzzed off. There was another rustle of foliage from the underbrush\nfive yards away. A bush quivered, then a low bough dipped.\n  \n \n  Retief edged back around the trunk, eased down behind a fallen log.\nA stocky man in grimy leather shirt and shorts appeared, moving\ncautiously, a pistol in his hand.\n  \n \n  As he passed, Retief rose, leaped the log and tackled him.\n  \n \n  They went down together. The stranger gave one short yell, then\nstruggled in silence. Retief flipped him onto his back, raised a fist—\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" the settler yelled. \"You're as human as I am!\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe I'll look better after a shave,\" said Retief. \"What's the idea\nof shooting at me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Lemme up. My name's Potter. Sorry 'bout that. I figured it was a\nFlap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something\nmove. Didn't know it was a Terrestrial. Who are you?

That's Flap-jack\ncountry over there.\" He waved a hand toward the north, where the desert\nlay.\n  \n \n  \"I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Missile, eh? Must be Flap-jack artillery. We got nothing like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard there was a full-fledged war brewing,\" said Retief. \"I didn't\nexpect—\"\n  \n \n  \"Good!\" Potter said. \"We figured a few of you boys from Ivory would be\njoining up when you heard. You are from Ivory?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. I'm—\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you must be Lemuel's cousin. Good night! I pretty near made a bad\nmistake. Lemuel's a tough man to explain something to.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm—\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep your head down. These damn Flap-jacks have got some wicked hand\nweapons. Come on....\" He moved off silently on all fours. Retief\nfollowed. They crossed two hundred yards of rough country before Potter\ngot to his feet, took out a soggy bandana and mopped his face.\n  \n \n  \"You move good for a city man.

Don't say anything to Lemuel about me thinking you were a\nFlap-jack.\"\n  \n \n  \"I won't, but—\"\n  \n \n  Potter was on his way, loping off up a gentle slope. Retief pulled off\nthe sodden blazer, dropped it over a bush, added his string tie and\nfollowed Potter.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"We're damn glad you're here, mister,\" said a fat man with two\nrevolvers belted across his paunch. \"We can use every hand.

There's no one down there at all—we're victims of the first joint hallucination in psychiatric history.\" Stryker threw up his hands in surrender. \"We can't identify them by theorizing, and that brings us down to the business of first-hand investigation. Who's going to bell the cat this time?\" \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said at once. \"The ZIT computer can wait.\" Stryker vetoed his offer as promptly. \"No, the ZIT comes first. We may have to run for it, and we can't set up a Transfer jump without the computer. It's got to be me or Arthur.\" Farrell felt the familiar chill of uneasiness that inevitably preceded this moment of decision. He was not lacking in courage, else the circumstances under which he had worked for the past ten years—the sometimes perilous, sometimes downright charnel conditions left by the fleeing Hymenop conquerors—would have broken him long ago. But that same hard experience had honed rather than blunted the edge of his imagination, and the prospect of a close-quarters stalking of an unknown and patently hostile force was anything but attractive. \"You two did the field work on the last location,\" he said. \"It's high time I took my turn—and God knows I'd go mad if I had to stay inship and listen to Lee memorizing his Handbook subsections or to Gib practicing dead languages with Xavier.\" Stryker laughed for the first time since the explosion that had so nearly wrecked the Marco Four . \"Good enough. Though it wouldn't be more diverting to listen for hours to you improvising enharmonic variations on the Lament for Old Terra with your accordion.\" Gibson, characteristically, had a refinement to offer. \"They'll be alerted down there for a reconnaissance sally,\" he said. \"Why not let Xavier take the scouter down for overt diversion, and drop Arthur off in the helihopper for a low-level check?\" Stryker looked at Farrell. \"All right, Arthur?\" \"Good enough,\" Farrell said. And to Xavier, who had not moved from his post at the magnoscanner: \"How does it look, Xav? Have you pinned down their base yet?\" The mechanical answered him in a voice as smooth and clear—and as inflectionless—as a 'cello note. \"The planet seems uninhabited except for a large island some three hundred miles in diameter. There are twenty-seven small agrarian hamlets surrounded by cultivated fields. There is one city of perhaps a thousand buildings with a central square. In the square rests a grounded spaceship of approximately ten times the bulk of the Marco Four .\" They crowded about the vision screen, jostling Xavier's jointed gray shape in their interest. The central city lay in minutest detail before them, the battered hulk of the grounded ship glinting rustily in the late afternoon sunlight. Streets radiated away from the square in orderly succession, the whole so clearly depicted that they could see the throngs of people surging up and down, tiny foreshortened faces turned toward the sky. \"At least they're human,\" Farrell said. Relief replaced in some measure his earlier uneasiness. \"Which means that they're Terran, and can be dealt with according to Reclamations routine. Is that hulk spaceworthy, Xav?\" Xavier's mellow drone assumed the convention vibrato that indicated stark puzzlement. \"Its breached hull makes the ship incapable of flight. Apparently it is used only to supply power to the outlying hamlets.\" The mechanical put a flexible gray finger upon an indicator graph derived from a composite section of detector meters. \"The power transmitted seems to be gross electric current conveyed by metallic cables. It is generated through a crudely governed process of continuous atomic fission.\" Farrell, himself appalled by the information, still found himself able to chuckle at Stryker's bellow of consternation. \" Continuous fission? Good God, only madmen would deliberately run a risk like that!\" Farrell prodded him with cheerful malice. \"Why say mad men ? Maybe they're humanoid aliens who thrive on hard radiation and look on the danger of being blown to hell in the middle of the night as a satisfactory risk.\" \"They're not alien,\" Gibson said positively. \"Their architecture is Terran, and so is their ship. The ship is incredibly primitive, though; those batteries of tubes at either end—\" \"Are thrust reaction jets,\" Stryker finished in an awed voice. \"Primitive isn't the word, Gib—the thing is prehistoric! Rocket propulsion hasn't been used in spacecraft since—how long, Xav?\" Xavier supplied the information with mechanical infallibility. \"Since the year 2100 when the Ringwave propulsion-communication principle was discovered. That principle has served men since.\" Farrell stared in blank disbelief at the anomalous craft on the screen. Primitive, as Stryker had said, was not the word for it: clumsily ovoid, studded with torpedo domes and turrets and bristling at either end with propulsion tubes, it lay at the center of its square like a rusted relic of a past largely destroyed and all but forgotten. What a magnificent disregard its builders must have had, he thought, for their lives and the genetic purity of their posterity! The sullen atomic fires banked in that oxidizing hulk— Stryker said plaintively, \"If you're right, Gib, then we're more in the dark than ever. How could a Terran-built ship eleven hundred years old get here ?\" Gibson, absorbed in his chess-player's contemplation of alternatives, seemed hardly to hear him. \"Logic or not-logic,\" Gibson said. \"If it's a Terran artifact, we can discover the reason for its presence. If not—\" \" Any problem posed by one group of human beings ,\" Stryker quoted his Handbook, \" can be resolved by any other group, regardless of ideology or conditioning, because the basic perceptive abilities of both must be the same through identical heredity .\" \"If it's an imitation, and this is another Hymenop experiment in condition ecology, then we're stumped to begin with,\" Gibson finished. \"Because we're not equipped to evaluate the psychology of alien motivation. We've got to determine first which case applies here.\" He waited for Farrell's expected irony, and when the navigator forestalled him by remaining grimly quiet, continued. \"The obvious premise is that a Terran ship must have been built by Terrans. Question: Was it flown here, or built here?\" \"It couldn't have been built here,\" Stryker said. \"Alphard Six was surveyed just before the Bees took over in 3025, and there was nothing of the sort here then. It couldn't have been built during the two and a quarter centuries since; it's obviously much older than that. It was flown here.\" \"We progress,\" Farrell said dryly. \"Now if you'll tell us how , we're ready to move.\" \"I think the ship was built on Terra during the Twenty-second Century,\" Gibson said calmly. \"The atomic wars during that period destroyed practically all historical records along with the technology of the time, but I've read well-authenticated reports of atomic-driven ships leaving Terra before then for the nearer stars. The human race climbed out of its pit again during the Twenty-third Century and developed the technology that gave us the Ringwave. Certainly no atomic-powered ships were built after the wars—our records are complete from that time.\" Farrell shook his head at the inference. \"I've read any number of fanciful romances on the theme, Gib, but it won't stand up in practice. No shipboard society could last through a thousand-year space voyage. It's a physical and psychological impossibility. There's got to be some other explanation.\" Gibson shrugged. \"We can only eliminate the least likely alternatives and accept the simplest one remaining.\" \"Then we can eliminate this one now,\" Farrell said flatly. \"It entails a thousand-year voyage, which is an impossibility for any gross reaction drive; the application of suspended animation or longevity or a successive-generation program, and a final penetration of Hymenop-occupied space to set up a colony under the very antennae of the Bees. Longevity wasn't developed until around the year 3000—Lee here was one of the first to profit by it, if you remember—and suspended animation is still to come. So there's one theory you can forget.\" \"Arthur's right,\" Stryker said reluctantly. \"An atomic-powered ship couldn't have made such a trip, Gib. And such a lineal-descendant project couldn't have lasted through forty generations, speculative fiction to the contrary—the later generations would have been too far removed in ideology and intent from their ancestors. They'd have adapted to shipboard life as the norm. They'd have atrophied physically, perhaps even have mutated—\" \"And they'd never have fought past the Bees during the Hymenop invasion and occupation,\" Farrell finished triumphantly. \"The Bees had better detection equipment than we had. They'd have picked this ship up long before it reached Alphard Six.\" \"But the ship wasn't here in 3000,\" Gibson said, \"and it is now. Therefore it must have arrived at some time during the two hundred years of Hymenop occupation and evacuation.\" Farrell, tangled in contradictions, swore bitterly. \"But why should the Bees let them through? The three domes on Five are over two hundred years old,\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_8]\nOutside on the starlit sand Retief tossed aside the power pistol,\nfollowed it with the leather shirt Swazey had lent him.

The conflict is ultimately revealed to be based on a misunderstanding of each other's territorial goals. The Terrestrials assume the Jaq want their fertile oases.

They are led by Hoshick, who has a strong interest in mining the deserts of Adobe for a special lichen used to craft their yellow wine. This wine would then be sold to planets across the universe. The Jaq make their headquarters in the desert. In the scattered oases of Adobe, the Terrestrial settlers have built farms in the rich soil of the planet's surface. The Terrestrials refer to the Jaq as \"Flap-jacks\" due to their unique physicality. One day, a Terrestrial man mistakes a Jaq for one of Adobe's native species, and he shoots and kills it. This ignites a war between the two groups. The central Terrestrials featured in the story--Potter, Lemuel, Bert, and Swazey--require assistance from their allies on Ivory because they only have three hundred men and are unsure they can defeat the Jaq. When the Embassy sends Retief to serve as an intermediary, he discovers that the two groups have similar interests--they each only want control of their separate areas. By craftily suggesting the use of weapons is no longer fashionable, Retief neutralizes the Jaq artillery and is able to convince both groups to reach a peace treaty. And, as it turns out, the Terrestrial settlements no longer have wine, so the adjacent existence of Jaq wine fields would have a mutual benefit.", "The Jaqs and the Terrestrials fight each other throughout the story. It started when a human saw a Jaq and thought it was some type of native game and shot it. From that incident, the Jaqs concluded that the humans were sportsmen like themselves and responded by going to one of the farms and killing two cows. Since then, the two sides have been attacking back and forth, and the humans think the Jaqs are fighting against them. Hoshick explains that he actually prefers the skirmishes to be without weapons. Until Retief meets with the Jaqs and talks with Hoshick, none of the humans had interacted with the Jaqs peacefully. The humans think the Jaqs want to take over all the oases, and the Jaqs think the humans want to take over all the deserts.", "The Jaqs and Terrestrials are at odds with each other over territorial rights on Adobe, but they clearly know nothing about each other, nor what the other group actually wants. A Terrestrial set off the disagreement by shooting at a Jaq, and the Jaqs have apparently killed several cows thinking they are humans. The Jaqs also believe that they are giving the Terrestrials what they want because they consider them fellow “sportsmen”, while the Terrestrials are actually dwindling in number and living in fear. While they continue raiding each other without talking, they fail to understand that different parts of the planet interest them, and they need not fight at all. By the end of the story, Retief has settled the dispute and both parties have been given the lands they desire; they now all happily reside on the planet together under the new agreement. \n", "The Terrestrials show up on Adobe thinking the land is uninhabited, but they quickly learn that the Flap-jacks are also there. One of the men shoots at an Adoban, and for three months, the Terrestrials engage in battle with the aliens. The Flap-jacks attack Swayzey’s farm and kill two of his cows. The next time they showed up, Potter and Swazey shot at them. The men describe the aliens as dirty blankets. \n\nThe Flap-jacks begin using more advanced weaponry, like airships and automatic rifles. With their new technology, they are able to kill more Terrestrials. The men are very concerned about protecting their farmlands, and they believe the aliens want to take them. \n\nRetief is put in charge of mending the relationship between the Terrestrials and the Flap-jacks, so he goes to meet with their leader. He learns how to appropriately attack a Flap-jack when one of them charges at him when he enters their territory. The aliens are muscular and heavy with fringe-tentacles, and Retief is able to subdue the Flap-jack by gouging its eye with his thumb. \n\nThe Flap-jack’s leader, Hoshick, is immediately cordial towards Retief. Hoshick must use a translating device to speak to him, but he is open to all kinds of suggestions from Retief. He has his waiter serve food and wine during their meeting, and he explains that once they figured out the Terrestrials were sportsmen, they wanted to up the ante and show them a good time with their advanced weaponry. In fact, Hoshick called in an additional hundred Adobans to make the fight more interesting. \n\nHoshick is quickly convinced that fighting with weapons is a lowly thing to do, and he agrees to fight Retief one-on-one. Hoshick loses the fight when Retief sticks his thumb in the alien’s eye. Hoshick is willing to give the Terrestrials all of their land, but he admits that he’s disappointed that he won’t be able to continue farming lichens in the desert in order to make their delicious and profitable wine. \n\nRetief agrees that the Flap-jacks can keep the sand hills they need for harvesting lichens as long as the Terrestrials can have the oases and the farmlands. Essentially, the entire war was a miscommunication. Neither side wanted what the other had, but without a discussion about why each party was on Adobe, it was completely unclear to everyone that their motivations were dissimilar. \n"]}}

Navigator Farrell, youngest and certainly most impulsive of the three-man Terran Reclamations crew, would have set the Marco Four down at once but for the greater caution of Stryker, nominally captain of the group, and of Gibson, engineer, and linguist. Xavier, the ship's little mechanical, had—as was usual and proper—no voice in the matter. \"Reconnaissance spiral first, Arthur,\" Stryker said firmly. He chuckled at Farrell's instant scowl, his little eyes twinkling and his naked paunch quaking over the belt of his shipboard shorts. \"Chapter One, Subsection Five, Paragraph Twenty-seven: No planetfall on an unreclaimed world shall be deemed safe without proper— \" Farrell, as Stryker had expected, interrupted with characteristic impatience. \"Do you sleep with that damned Reclamations Handbook, Lee? Alphard Six isn't an unreclaimed world—it was never colonized before the Hymenop invasion back in 3025, so why should it be inhabited now?\" Gibson, who for four hours had not looked up from his interminable chess game with Xavier, paused with a beleaguered knight in one blunt brown hand. \"No point in taking chances,\" Gibson said in his neutral baritone. He shrugged thick bare shoulders, his humorless black-browed face unmoved, when Farrell included him in his scowl. \"We're two hundred twenty-six light-years from Sol, at the old limits of Terran expansion, and there's no knowing what we may turn up here. Alphard's was one of the first systems the Bees took over. It must have been one of the last to be abandoned when they pulled back to 70 Ophiuchi.\" \"And I think you live for the day,\" Farrell said acidly, \"when we'll stumble across a functioning dome of live, buzzing Hymenops. Damn it, Gib, the Bees pulled out a hundred years ago, before you and I were born—neither of us ever saw a Hymenop, and never will!\" \"But I saw them,\" Stryker said. \"I fought them for the better part of the century they were here, and I learned there's no predicting nor understanding them. We never knew why they came nor why they gave up and left. How can we know whether they'd leave a rear-guard or booby trap here?\" He put a paternal hand on Farrell's shoulder, understanding the younger man's eagerness and knowing that their close-knit team would have been the more poorly balanced without it. \"Gib's right,\" he said. He nearly added as usual . \"We're on rest leave at the moment, yes, but our mission is still to find Terran colonies enslaved and abandoned by the Bees, not to risk our necks and a valuable Reorientations ship by landing blind on an unobserved planet. We're too close already. Cut in your shields and find a reconnaissance spiral, will you?\" Grumbling, Farrell punched coordinates on the Ringwave board that lifted the Marco Four out of her descent and restored the bluish enveloping haze of her repellors. Stryker's caution was justified on the instant. The speeding streamlined shape that had flashed up unobserved from below swerved sharply and exploded in a cataclysmic blaze of atomic fire that rocked the ship wildly and flung the three men to the floor in a jangling roar of alarms. \"So the Handbook tacticians knew what they were about,\" Stryker said minutes later. Deliberately he adopted the smug tone best calculated to sting Farrell out of his first self-reproach, and grinned when the navigator bristled defensively. \"Some of their enjoinders seem a little stuffy and obvious at times, but they're eminently sensible.\" When Farrell refused to be baited Stryker turned to Gibson, who was busily assessing the damage done to the ship's more fragile equipment, and to Xavier, who searched the planet's surface with the ship's magnoscanner. The Marco Four , Ringwave generators humming gently, hung at the moment just inside the orbit of Alphard Six's single dun-colored moon. Gibson put down a test meter with an air of finality. \"Nothing damaged but the Zero Interval Transfer computer. I can realign that in a couple of hours, but it'll have to be done before we hit Transfer again.\" Stryker looked dubious. \"What if the issue is forced before the ZIT unit is repaired? Suppose they come up after us?\" \"I doubt that they can. Any installation crudely enough equipped to trust in guided missiles is hardly likely to have developed efficient space craft.\" Stryker was not reassured. \"That torpedo of theirs was deadly enough,\" he said. \"And its nature reflects the nature of the people who made it. Any race vicious enough to use atomic charges is too dangerous to trifle with.\" Worry made comical creases in his fat, good-humored face. \"We'll have to find out who they are and why they're here, you know.\" \"They can't be Hymenops,\" Gibson said promptly. \"First, because the Bees pinned their faith on Ringwave energy fields, as we did, rather than on missiles. Second, because there's no dome on Six.\" \"There were three empty domes on Five, which is a desert planet,\" Farrell pointed out. \"Why didn't they settle Six? It's a more habitable world.\" Gibson shrugged. \"I know the Bees always erected domes on every planet they colonized, Arthur, but precedent is a fallible tool. And it's even more firmly established that there's no possibility of our rationalizing the motivations of a culture as alien as the Hymenops'—we've been over that argument a hundred times on other reclaimed worlds.\" \"But this was never an unreclaimed world,\" Farrell said with the faint malice of one too recently caught in the wrong. \"Alphard Six was surveyed and seeded with Terran bacteria around the year 3000, but the Bees invaded before we could colonize. And that means we'll have to rule out any resurgent colonial group down there, because Six never had a colony in the beginning.\" \"The Bees have been gone for over a hundred years,\" Stryker said. \"Colonists might have migrated from another Terran-occupied planet.\" Gibson disagreed. \"We've touched at every inhabited world in this sector, Lee, and not one surviving colony has developed space travel on its own. The Hymenops had a hundred years to condition their human slaves to ignorance of everything beyond their immediate environment—the motives behind that conditioning usually escape us, but that's beside the point—and they did a thorough job of it. The colonists have had no more than a century of freedom since the Bees pulled out, and four generations simply isn't enough time for any subjugated culture to climb from slavery to interstellar flight.\" Stryker made a padding turn about the control room, tugging unhappily at the scanty fringe of hair the years had left him. \"If they're neither Hymenops nor resurgent colonists,\" he said, \"then there's only one choice remaining—they're aliens from a system we haven't reached yet, beyond the old sphere of Terran exploration. We always assumed that we'd find other races out here someday, and that they'd be as different from us in form and motivation as the Hymenops. Why not now?\" Gibson said seriously, \"Not probable, Lee. The same objection that rules out the Bees applies to any trans-Alphardian culture—they'd have to be beyond the atomic fission stage, else they'd never have attempted interstellar flight. The Ringwave with its Zero Interval Transfer principle and instantaneous communications applications is the only answer to long-range travel, and if they'd had that they wouldn't have bothered with atomics.\" Stryker turned on him almost angrily. \"If they're not Hymenops or humans or aliens, then what in God's name are they?\" \"Aye, there's the rub,\" Farrell said, quoting a passage whose aptness had somehow seen it through a dozen reorganizations of insular tongue and a final translation to universal Terran. \"If they're none of those three, we've only one conclusion left. There's no one down there at all—we're victims of the first joint hallucination in psychiatric history.\" Stryker threw up his hands in surrender. \"We can't identify them by theorizing, and that brings us down to the business of first-hand investigation. Who's going to bell the cat this time?\" \"I'd like to go,\" Gibson said at once. \"The ZIT computer can wait.\" Stryker vetoed his offer as promptly. \"No, the ZIT comes first. We may have to run for it, and we can't set up a Transfer jump without the computer. It's got to be me or Arthur.\" Farrell felt the familiar chill of uneasiness that inevitably preceded this moment of decision. He was not lacking in courage, else the circumstances under which he had worked for the past ten years—the sometimes perilous, sometimes downright charnel conditions left by the fleeing Hymenop conquerors—would have broken him long ago. But that same hard experience had honed rather than blunted the edge of his imagination, and the prospect of a close-quarters stalking of an unknown and patently hostile force was anything but attractive. \"You two did the\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_4]\nRetief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain—\"\n  \n \n  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n  \n \n  \"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\n  \n \n  Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n  \n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n  \n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire—\n  \n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n  \n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_8]\nOutside on the starlit sand Retief tossed aside the power pistol,\nfollowed it with the leather shirt Swazey had lent him. By the faint\nlight he could just make out the towering figure of the Flap-jack\nrearing up before him, his trappings gone. A silent rank of Flap-jack\nretainers were grouped behind him.\n  \n \n  \"I fear I must lay aside the translator now, Retief,\" said Hoshick.\nHe sighed and rippled his fringe tentacles. \"My spawn-fellows will\nnever credit this. Such a curious turn fashion has taken. How much\nmore pleasant it is to observe the action of the skirmishforms from a\ndistance.\"\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we use Tennessee rules,\" said Retief. \"They're very liberal.\nBiting, gouging, stomping, kneeing and of course choking, as well as\nthe usual punching, shoving and kicking.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hmmm. These gambits seem geared to forms employing rigid\nendo-skeletons; I fear I shall be at a disadvantage.\"\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Retief said, \"if you'd prefer a more plebeian type of\ncontest....\"\n  \n \n  \"By no means. But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to\neven it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very well. Shall we begin?\"\n  \n \n  With a rush Hoshick threw himself at Retief, who ducked, whirled, and\nleaped on the Flap-jack's back ... and felt himself flipped clear by\na mighty ripple of the alien's slab-like body. Retief rolled aside\nas Hoshick turned on him; he jumped to his feet and threw a right\nhay-maker to Hoshick's mid-section. The alien whipped his left fringe\naround in an arc that connected with Retief's jaw, sent him spinning\nonto his back ... and Hoshick's weight struck him.\n  \n \n \n \n  Retief twisted, tried to roll. The flat body of the alien blanketed\nhim. He worked an arm free, drumming blows on the leathery back.\nHoshick nestled closer.\n  \n \n  Retief's air was running out. He heaved up against the smothering\nweight. Nothing budged.\n  \n \n  It was like burial under a dump-truck-load of concrete.\n  \n \n  He remembered the rangerform he had captured. The sensitive orifice\nhad been placed ventrally, in what would be the thoracic area....\n  \n \n  He groped, felt tough hide set with horny granules. He would be missing\nskin tomorrow ... if there was a tomorrow. His thumb found the orifice\nand probed.\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack recoiled. Retief held fast, probed deeper, groping with\nthe other hand. If the alien were bilaterally symmetrical there would\nbe a set of ready made hand-holds....\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_3]\nCoughing, Retief disengaged himself from the shock-webbing. He beat\nout sparks in his lap, groped underfoot for the hatch and wrenched it\nopen. A wave of hot jungle air struck him. He lowered himself to a bed\nof shattered foliage, got to his feet ... and dropped flat as a bullet\nwhined past his ear.\n  \n \n  He lay listening. Stealthy movements were audible from the left.\n  \n \n  He inched his way to the shelter of a broad-boled dwarf tree. Somewhere\na song lizard burbled. Whining insects circled, scented alien life,\nbuzzed off. There was another rustle of foliage from the underbrush\nfive yards away. A bush quivered, then a low bough dipped.\n  \n \n  Retief edged back around the trunk, eased down behind a fallen log.\nA stocky man in grimy leather shirt and shorts appeared, moving\ncautiously, a pistol in his hand.\n  \n \n  As he passed, Retief rose, leaped the log and tackled him.\n  \n \n  They went down together. The stranger gave one short yell, then\nstruggled in silence. Retief flipped him onto his back, raised a fist—\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" the settler yelled. \"You're as human as I am!\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe I'll look better after a shave,\" said Retief. \"What's the idea\nof shooting at me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Lemme up. My name's Potter. Sorry 'bout that. I figured it was a\nFlap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something\nmove. Didn't know it was a Terrestrial. Who are you? What you doin'\nhere? We're pretty close to the edge of the oases. That's Flap-jack\ncountry over there.\" He waved a hand toward the north, where the desert\nlay.\n  \n \n  \"I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Missile, eh? Must be Flap-jack artillery. We got nothing like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard there was a full-fledged war brewing,\" said Retief. \"I didn't\nexpect—\"\n  \n \n  \"Good!\" Potter said. \"We figured a few of you boys from Ivory would be\njoining up when you heard. You are from Ivory?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. I'm—\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you must be Lemuel's cousin. Good night! I pretty near made a bad\nmistake. Lemuel's a tough man to explain something to.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm—\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep your head down. These damn Flap-jacks have got some wicked hand\nweapons. Come on....\" He moved off silently on all fours. Retief\nfollowed. They crossed two hundred yards of rough country before Potter\ngot to his feet, took out a soggy bandana and mopped his face.\n  \n \n  \"You move good for a city man. I thought you folks on Ivory just sat\nunder those domes and read dials. But I guess bein' Lemuel's cousin you\nwas raised different.\"\n  \n \n  \"As a matter of fact—\"\n  \n \n  \"Have to get you some real clothes, though. Those city duds don't stand\nup on 'Dobe.\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked down at the charred, torn and sweat-soaked powder-blue\nblazer and slacks.\n  \n \n  \"This outfit seemed pretty rough-and-ready back home,\" he said. \"But I\nguess leather has its points.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's get on back to camp. We'll just about make it by sundown.\nAnd, look. Don't say anything to Lemuel about me thinking you were a\nFlap-jack.\"\n  \n \n  \"I won't, but—\"\n  \n \n  Potter was on his way, loping off up a gentle slope. Retief pulled off\nthe sodden blazer, dropped it over a bush, added his string tie and\nfollowed Potter.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"We're damn glad you're here, mister,\" said a fat man with two\nrevolvers belted across his paunch. \"We can use every hand. We're in\nbad shape. We ran into the Flap-jacks three months ago and we haven't\nmade a smart move since. First, we thought they were a native form we\nhadn't run into before. Fact is, one of the boys shot one, thinkin' it\nwas fair game. I guess that was the start of it.\" He stirred the fire,\nadded a stick.\n  \n \n  \"And then a bunch of 'em hit Swazey's farm here,\" Potter said. \"Killed\ntwo of his cattle, and pulled back.\"\n  \n \n  \"I figure they thought the cows were people,\" said Swazey. \"They were\nout for revenge.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could anybody think a cow was folks?\" another man put in. \"They\ndon't look nothin' like—\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be so dumb, Bert,\" said Swazey. \"They'd never seen Terries\nbefore. They know better now.\"\n  \n \n  Bert chuckled. \"Sure do. We showed 'em the next time, didn't we,\nPotter? Got four.\"\n  \n \n  \"They walked right up to my place a couple days after the first time,\"\nSwazey said. \"We were ready for 'em. Peppered 'em good. They cut and\nrun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Flopped, you mean. Ugliest lookin' critters you ever saw. Look just\nlike a old piece of dirty blanket humpin' around.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's been goin' on this way ever since. They raid and then we raid.\nBut lately they've been bringing some big stuff into it. They've got\nsome kind of pint-sized airships and automatic rifles. We've lost four\nmen now and a dozen more in the freezer, waiting for the med ship. We\ncan't afford it. The colony's got less than three hundred able-bodied\nmen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we're hanging onto our farms,\" said Potter. \"All these oases are\nold sea-beds—a mile deep, solid topsoil. And there's a couple of\nhundred others we haven't touched yet. The Flap-jacks won't get 'em\nwhile there's a man alive.\"\n  \n \n  \"The whole system needs the food we can raise,\" Bert said. \"These farms\nwe're trying to start won't be enough but they'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"We been yellin' for help to the CDT, over on Ivory,\" said Potter. \"But\nyou know these Embassy stooges.\"\n  \n \n  \"We heard they were sending some kind of bureaucrat in here to tell\nus to get out and give the oases to the Flap-jacks,\" said Swazey. He\ntightened his mouth. \"We're waitin' for him....\"\n  \n \n  \"Meanwhile we got reinforcements comin' up, eh, boys?\" Bert winked at\nRetief. \"We put out the word back home. We all got relatives on Ivory\nand Verde.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, you damn fool!\" a deep voice grated.\n  \n \n  \"Lemuel!\" Potter said. \"Nobody else could sneak up on us like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"If I'd a been a Flap-jack; I'd of et you alive,\" the newcomer said,\nmoving into the ring of fire, a tall, broad-faced man in grimy leather.\nHe eyed Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Who's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do ya mean?\" Potter spoke in the silence. \"He's your cousin....\"\n  \n \n  \"He ain't no cousin of mine,\" Lemuel said slowly. He stepped to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Who you spyin' for, stranger?\" he rasped.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_9]\nThere were.\n  \n \n  Retief dug in and the Flap-jack writhed, pulled away. Retief held on,\nscrambled to his feet, threw his weight against the alien and fell on\ntop of him, still gouging. Hoshick rippled his fringe wildly, flopped\nin terror, then went limp.\n  \n \n  Retief relaxed, released his hold and got to his feet, breathing hard.\nHoshick humped himself over onto his ventral side, lifted and moved\ngingerly over to the sidelines. His retainers came forward, assisted\nhim into his trappings, strapped on the translator. He sighed heavily,\nadjusted the volume.\n  \n \n  \"There is much to be said for the old system,\" he said. \"What a burden\none's sportsmanship places on one at times.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great sport, wasn't it?\" said Retief. \"Now, I know you'll be eager to\ncontinue. If you'll just wait while I run back and fetch some of our\ngougerforms—\"\n  \n \n  \"May hide-ticks devour the gougerforms!\" Hoshick bellowed. \"You've\ngiven me such a sprong-ache as I'll remember each spawning-time for a\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speaking of hide-ticks,\" said Retief, \"we've developed a biterform—\"\n  \n \n  \"Enough!\" Hoshick roared, so loudly that the translator bounced on his\nhide. \"Suddenly I yearn for the crowded yellow sands of Jaq. I had\nhoped....\" He broke off, drew a rasping breath. \"I had hoped, Retief,\"\nhe said, speaking sadly now, \"to find a new land here where I might\nplan my own Mosaic, till these alien sands and bring forth such a crop\nof paradise-lichen as should glut the markets of a hundred worlds. But\nmy spirit is not equal to the prospect of biterforms and gougerforms\nwithout end. I am shamed before you....\"\n  \n \n  \"To tell you the truth, I'm old-fashioned myself. I'd rather watch the\naction from a distance too.\"\n  \n \n  \"But surely your spawn-fellows would never condone such an attitude.\"\n  \n \n  \"My spawn-fellows aren't here. And besides, didn't I mention it? No\none who's really in the know would think of engaging in competition by\nmere combat if there were any other way. Now, you mentioned tilling the\nsand, raising lichens—things like that—\"\n  \n \n  \"That on which we dined but now,\" said Hoshick, \"and from which the\nwine is made.\"\n  \n \n  \"The big news in fashionable diplomacy today is farming competition.\nNow, if you'd like to take these deserts and raise lichen, we'll\npromise to stick to the oases and vegetables.\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick curled his back in attention. \"Retief, you're quite serious?\nYou would leave all the fair sand hills to us?\"\n  \n \n  \"The whole works, Hoshick. I'll take the oases.\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick rippled his fringes ecstatically. \"Once again you have outdone\nme, Retief,\" he cried. \"This time, in generosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll talk over the details later. I'm sure we can establish a set of\nrules that will satisfy all parties. Now I've got to get back. I think\nsome of the gougerforms are waiting to see me.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  It was nearly dawn when Retief gave the whistled signal he had agreed\non with Potter, then rose and walked into the camp circle. Swazey stood\nup.\n  \n \n  \"There you are,\" he said. \"We been wonderin' whether to go out after\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel came forward, one eye black to the cheekbone. He held out a\nraw-boned hand. \"Sorry I jumped you, stranger. Tell you the truth, I\nthought you was some kind of stool-pigeon from the CDT.\"\n  \n \n  Bert came up behind Lemuel. \"How do you know he ain't, Lemuel?\" he\nsaid. \"Maybe he—\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel floored Bert with a backward sweep of his arm. \"Next\ncotton-picker says some embassy Johnny can cool me gets worse'n that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell me,\" said Retief. \"How are you boys fixed for wine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wine? Mister, we been livin' on stump water for a year now. 'Dobe's\nfatal to the kind of bacteria it takes to ferment likker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Try this.\" Retief handed over a sqat jug. Swazey drew the cork,\nsniffed, drank and passed it to Lemuel.\n  \n \n  \"Mister, where'd you get that?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Flap-jacks make it. Here's another question for you: Would you\nconcede a share in this planet to the Flap-jacks in return for a peace\nguarantee?\"\n  \n \n  At the end of a half hour of heated debate Lemuel turned to Retief.\n\"We'll make any reasonable deal,\" he said. \"I guess they got as much\nright here as we have. I think we'd agree to a fifty-fifty split.\nThat'd give about a hundred and fifty oases to each side.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you say to keeping all the oases and giving them the\ndesert?\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel reached for the wine jug, eyes on Retief. \"Keep talkin',\nmister,\" he said. \"I think you got yourself a deal.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_6]\nTwenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart\nof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry\nforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n  \n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n  \n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears—or no ears at all—but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n  \n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n  \n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n  \n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n  \n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n  \n \n  \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n  \n \n  \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Delighted.\"\n  \n \n  Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n  \n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit—\"\n  \n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n  \n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n  \n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n  \n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n  \n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n  \n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n  \n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n  \n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_7]\nA scratchy sound issued from the disk. \"Pardon my laughter,\" Hoshick\nsaid, \"but surely you jest?\"\n  \n \n  \"As a matter of fact,\" said Retief, \"we ourselves seldom use weapons.\"\n  \n \n  \"I seem to recall that our first contact of skirmishforms involved the\nuse of a weapon by one of your units.\"\n  \n \n  \"My apologies,\" said Retief. \"The—ah—the skirmishform failed to\nrecognize that he was dealing with a sportsman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Still, now that we have commenced so merrily with weapons....\" Hoshick\nsignaled and the servant refilled tubes.\n  \n \n  \"There is an aspect I haven't yet mentioned,\" Retief went on. \"I hope\nyou won't take this personally, but the fact is, our skirmishforms\nthink of weapons as something one employs only in dealing with certain\nspecific life-forms.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Curious. What forms are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, but\nlacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of such\nworthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you to\npoint it out.\" Hoshick clucked in dismay. \"I see that skirmishforms are\nmuch the same among you as with us: lacking in perception.\" He laughed\nscratchily. \"Imagine considering us as—what was the word?—varmints.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up against\na serious problem with regard to skirmishforms. A low birth rate.\nTherefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actions\nso dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end to\nthese contests altogether....\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air.\n\"What are you saying?\" he gasped. \"Are you proposing that Hoshick of\nthe Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir!\" said Retief sternly. \"You forget yourself. I, Retief of the Red\nTape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with the\nnewest sporting principles.\"\n  \n \n  \"New?\" cried Hoshick. \"My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'm\nenthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and the\ntwo individuals settle the issue between them.\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... um ... fear I don't understand. What possible significance could\none attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't made myself clear,\" said Retief. He took a sip of wine. \"We\ndon't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean...?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. You and me.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_1]\nRETIEF OF THE RED-TAPE MOUNTAIN\n  \n \n  by KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Retief knew the importance of sealed\n   \n  orders—and the need to keep them that way!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, May 1962.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  \"It's true,\" Consul Passwyn said, \"I requested assignment as principal\nofficer at a small post.

Something had\nseparated itself from a dark mass of stone, glided across a few yards\nof open ground to another shelter. Retief watched. Minutes passed. The\nshape moved again, slipped into a shadow ten feet distant. Retief felt\nthe butt of the power pistol with his elbow. His guess had better be\nright this time....\n  \n \n  There was a sudden rasp, like leather against concrete, and a flurry of\nsand as the Flap-jack charged.\n  \n \n  Retief rolled aside, then lunged, threw his weight on the flopping\nFlap-jack—a yard square, three inches thick at the center and all\nmuscle. The ray-like creature heaved up, curled backward, its edge\nrippling, to stand on the flattened rim of its encircling sphincter.\nIt scrabbled with prehensile fringe-tentacles for a grip on Retief's\nshoulders. He wrapped his arms around the alien and struggled to his\nfeet. The thing was heavy. A hundred pounds at least. Fighting as it\nwas, it seemed more like five hundred.\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack reversed its tactics, went limp. Retief grabbed, felt a\nthumb slip into an orifice—\n  \n \n  The alien went wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, fellow,\" he muttered between clenched teeth. \"Eye-gouging isn't\ngentlemanly, but it's effective....\"\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack fell still, only its fringes rippling slowly. Retief\nrelaxed the pressure of his thumb; the alien gave a tentative jerk; the\nthumb dug in.\n  \n \n  The alien went limp again, waiting.\n  \n \n  \"Now we understand each other,\" said Retief. \"Take me to your leader.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_2]\nThe mail pilot, a leathery veteran with quarter-inch whiskers, spat\ntoward a stained corner of the compartment, leaned close to the screen.\n  \n \n  \"They's shootin' goin' on down there,\" he said. \"See them white puffs\nover the edge of the desert?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm supposed to be preventing the war,\" said Retief. \"It looks like\nI'm a little late.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot's head snapped around. \"War?\" he yelped. \"Nobody told me they\nwas a war goin' on on 'Dobe.

I said I've got to get down.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief\nblocked casually. \"Are you nuts?\" the pilot screeched. \"They's plenty\nshootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.\"\n  \n \n  \"The mail must go through, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay!

The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a\nheavy old-fashioned power pistol. \"Long as you're goin' in, might as\nwell take this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks.\" Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. \"I hope you're wrong.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over—one way or another.\"\n  \n \n  The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiff\ndropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the\ndeparting mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the\nmanual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....\n  \n \n  A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.\n  \n \n  Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy\nradiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed\nbut by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a\nhigh trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....\n  \n \n  Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.\n  \n \n  He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This\nwas going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief\nthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the\noncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,\ncorrecting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no\nmore than 1000 yards.\n  \n \n  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past\nthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining\nharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and\nharmless.\n  \n \n  Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.\nRetief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on\nits back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment.

Something had\nseparated itself from a dark mass of stone, glided across a few yards\nof open ground to another shelter. Retief watched. Minutes passed. The\nshape moved again, slipped into a shadow ten feet distant. Retief felt\nthe butt of the power pistol with his elbow. His guess had better be\nright this time....\n  \n \n  There was a sudden rasp, like leather against concrete, and a flurry of\nsand as the Flap-jack charged.\n  \n \n  Retief rolled aside, then lunged, threw his weight on the flopping\nFlap-jack—a yard square, three inches thick at the center and all\nmuscle. The ray-like creature heaved up, curled backward, its edge\nrippling, to stand on the flattened rim of its encircling sphincter.\nIt scrabbled with prehensile fringe-tentacles for a grip on Retief's\nshoulders. He wrapped his arms around the alien and struggled to his\nfeet. The thing was heavy. A hundred pounds at least. Fighting as it\nwas, it seemed more like five hundred.\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack reversed its tactics, went limp. Retief grabbed, felt a\nthumb slip into an orifice—\n  \n \n  The alien went wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, fellow,\" he muttered between clenched teeth. \"Eye-gouging isn't\ngentlemanly, but it's effective....\"\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack fell still, only its fringes rippling slowly. Retief\nrelaxed the pressure of his thumb; the alien gave a tentative jerk; the\nthumb dug in.\n  \n \n  The alien went limp again, waiting.\n  \n \n  \"Now we understand each other,\" said Retief. \"Take me to your leader.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_6]\nTwenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart\nof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry\nforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n  \n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n  \n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears—or no ears at all—but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n  \n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n  \n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n  \n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n  \n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n  \n \n  \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n  \n \n  \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Delighted.\"\n  \n \n  Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n  \n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit—\"\n  \n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n  \n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n  \n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n  \n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n  \n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n  \n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n  \n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n  \n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_7]\nA scratchy sound issued from the disk. \"Pardon my laughter,\" Hoshick\nsaid, \"but surely you jest?\"\n  \n \n  \"As a matter of fact,\" said Retief, \"we ourselves seldom use weapons.\"\n  \n \n  \"I seem to recall that our first contact of skirmishforms involved the\nuse of a weapon by one of your units.\"\n  \n \n  \"My apologies,\" said Retief. \"The—ah—the skirmishform failed to\nrecognize that he was dealing with a sportsman.\"\n  \n \n  \"Still, now that we have commenced so merrily with weapons....\" Hoshick\nsignaled and the servant refilled tubes.\n  \n \n  \"There is an aspect I haven't yet mentioned,\" Retief went on. \"I hope\nyou won't take this personally, but the fact is, our skirmishforms\nthink of weapons as something one employs only in dealing with certain\nspecific life-forms.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? Curious. What forms are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, but\nlacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of such\nworthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.\"\n  \n \n  \"Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you to\npoint it out.\" Hoshick clucked in dismay. \"I see that skirmishforms are\nmuch the same among you as with us: lacking in perception.\" He laughed\nscratchily. \"Imagine considering us as—what was the word?—varmints.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up against\na serious problem with regard to skirmishforms. A low birth rate.\nTherefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actions\nso dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end to\nthese contests altogether....\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air.\n\"What are you saying?\" he gasped. \"Are you proposing that Hoshick of\nthe Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?\"\n  \n \n  \"Sir!\" said Retief sternly. \"You forget yourself. I, Retief of the Red\nTape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with the\nnewest sporting principles.\"\n  \n \n  \"New?\" cried Hoshick. \"My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'm\nenthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and the\ntwo individuals settle the issue between them.\"\n  \n \n  \"I ... um ... fear I don't understand. What possible significance could\none attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?\"\n  \n \n  \"I haven't made myself clear,\" said Retief. He took a sip of wine. \"We\ndon't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't mean...?\"\n  \n \n  \"That's right. You and me.\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_DESERT_AND_THE_STARS_7]\nThe Aga Kaga guffawed. \"For a diplomat, you speak plainly, Retief. Have\nanother drink.\" He poured, eyeing Georges. \"What of M. Duror? How does\nhe feel about it?\"\n  \n \n  Georges took a thoughtful swallow of whiskey. \"Not bad,\" he said. \"But\nnot quite good enough to cover the odor of goats.\"\n  \n \n  The Aga Kaga snorted. \"I thought the goats were overdoing it a bit\nmyself,\" he said. \"Still, the graybeards insisted. And I need their\nsupport.\"\n  \n \n  \"Also,\" Georges said distinctly, \"I think you're soft. You lie around\nletting women wait on you, while your betters are out doing an honest\nday's work.\"\n  \n \n  The Aga Kaga looked startled. \"Soft? I can tie a knot in an iron bar\nas big as your thumb.\" He popped a grape into his mouth. \"As for the\nrest, your pious views about the virtues of hard labor are as childish\nas my advisors' faith in the advantages of primitive plumbing. As for\nmyself, I am a realist. If two monkeys want the same banana, in the end\none will have it, and the other will cry morality. The days of my years\nare numbered, praise be to God. While they last, I hope to eat well,\nhunt well, fight well and take my share of pleasure. I leave to others\nthe arid satisfactions of self-denial and other perversions.\"\n  \n \n  \"You admit you're here to grab our land, then,\" Georges said. \"That's\nthe damnedest piece of bare-faced aggression—\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, ah!\" The Aga Kaga held up a hand. \"Watch your vocabulary, my\ndear sir. I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorial\nself-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation. Or\npossibly 'legitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerly\nexploited peoples' might fit the case. Aggression is, by definition,\nan activity carried on only by those who have inherited the mantle of\nColonial Imperialism.\"\n  \n \n  \"Imperialism! Why, you Aga Kagans have been the most notorious\nplanet-grabbers in Sector history, you—you—\"\n  \n \n  \"Call me Stanley.\" The Aga Kaga munched a grape. \"I merely face the\nrealities of popular folk-lore. Let's be pragmatic; it's a matter of\nhistorical association. Some people can grab land and pass it off\nlightly as a moral duty; others are dubbed imperialist merely for\nholding onto their own. Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends.\nAnd I shall continue to take every advantage of it.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll fight you!\" Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskey\nand slammed the glass down. \"You won't take this world without a\nstruggle!\"\n  \n \n  \"Another?\" the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle. Georges glowered as\nhis glass was filled. The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light.\n  \n \n  \"Excellent color, don't you agree?\" He turned his eyes on Georges.\n  \n \n  \"It's pointless to resist,\" he said. \"We have you outgunned and\noutmanned. Your small nation has no chance against us. But we're\nprepared to be generous.

He beat\nout sparks in his lap, groped underfoot for the hatch and wrenched it\nopen. A wave of hot jungle air struck him. He lowered himself to a bed\nof shattered foliage, got to his feet ... and dropped flat as a bullet\nwhined past his ear.\n  \n \n  He lay listening. Stealthy movements were audible from the left.\n  \n \n  He inched his way to the shelter of a broad-boled dwarf tree. Somewhere\na song lizard burbled. Whining insects circled, scented alien life,\nbuzzed off. There was another rustle of foliage from the underbrush\nfive yards away. A bush quivered, then a low bough dipped.\n  \n \n  Retief edged back around the trunk, eased down behind a fallen log.\nA stocky man in grimy leather shirt and shorts appeared, moving\ncautiously, a pistol in his hand.\n  \n \n  As he passed, Retief rose, leaped the log and tackled him.\n  \n \n  They went down together. The stranger gave one short yell, then\nstruggled in silence. Retief flipped him onto his back, raised a fist—\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" the settler yelled. \"You're as human as I am!\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe I'll look better after a shave,\" said Retief. \"What's the idea\nof shooting at me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Lemme up. My name's Potter. Sorry 'bout that. I figured it was a\nFlap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something\nmove. Didn't know it was a Terrestrial. Who are you? What you doin'\nhere? We're pretty close to the edge of the oases. That's Flap-jack\ncountry over there.\" He waved a hand toward the north, where the desert\nlay.\n  \n \n  \"I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Missile, eh? Must be Flap-jack artillery. We got nothing like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard there was a full-fledged war brewing,\" said Retief. \"I didn't\nexpect—\"\n  \n \n  \"Good!\" Potter said. \"We figured a few of you boys from Ivory would be\njoining up when you heard. You are from Ivory?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. I'm—\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you must be Lemuel's cousin. Good night! I pretty near made a bad\nmistake. Lemuel's a tough man to explain something to.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm—\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep your head down. These damn Flap-jacks have got some wicked hand\nweapons. Come on....\" He moved off silently on all fours. Retief\nfollowed. They crossed two hundred yards of rough country before Potter\ngot to his feet, took out a soggy bandana and mopped his face.\n  \n \n  \"You move good for a city man. I thought you folks on Ivory just sat\nunder those domes and read dials. But I guess bein' Lemuel's cousin you\nwas raised different.\"\n  \n \n  \"As a matter of fact—\"\n  \n \n  \"Have to get you some real clothes, though. Those city duds don't stand\nup on 'Dobe.\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked down at the charred, torn and sweat-soaked powder-blue\nblazer and slacks.\n  \n \n  \"This outfit seemed pretty rough-and-ready back home,\" he said. \"But I\nguess leather has its points.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's get on back to camp. We'll just about make it by sundown.\nAnd, look. Don't say anything to Lemuel about me thinking you were a\nFlap-jack.\"\n  \n \n  \"I won't, but—\"\n  \n \n  Potter was on his way, loping off up a gentle slope. Retief pulled off\nthe sodden blazer, dropped it over a bush, added his string tie and\nfollowed Potter.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"We're damn glad you're here, mister,\" said a fat man with two\nrevolvers belted across his paunch. \"We can use every hand. We're in\nbad shape. We ran into the Flap-jacks three months ago and we haven't\nmade a smart move since. First, we thought they were a native form we\nhadn't run into before. Fact is, one of the boys shot one, thinkin' it\nwas fair game. I guess that was the start of it.\" He stirred the fire,\nadded a stick.\n  \n \n  \"And then a bunch of 'em hit Swazey's farm here,\" Potter said. \"Killed\ntwo of his cattle, and pulled back.\"\n  \n \n  \"I figure they thought the cows were people,\" said Swazey. \"They were\nout for revenge.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could anybody think a cow was folks?\" another man put in. \"They\ndon't look nothin' like—\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be so dumb, Bert,\" said Swazey. \"They'd never seen Terries\nbefore. They know better now.\"\n  \n \n  Bert chuckled. \"Sure do. We showed 'em the next time, didn't we,\nPotter? Got four.\"\n  \n \n  \"They walked right up to my place a couple days after the first time,\"\nSwazey said. \"We were ready for 'em. Peppered 'em good. They cut and\nrun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Flopped, you mean. Ugliest lookin' critters you ever saw. Look just\nlike a old piece of dirty blanket humpin' around.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's been goin' on this way ever since. They raid and then we raid.\nBut lately they've been bringing some big stuff into it. They've got\nsome kind of pint-sized airships and automatic rifles. We've lost four\nmen now and a dozen more in the freezer, waiting for the med ship. We\ncan't afford it. The colony's got less than three hundred able-bodied\nmen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we're hanging onto our farms,\" said Potter. \"All these oases are\nold sea-beds—a mile deep, solid topsoil. And there's a couple of\nhundred others we haven't touched yet. The Flap-jacks won't get 'em\nwhile there's a man alive.\"\n  \n \n  \"The whole system needs the food we can raise,\" Bert said. \"These farms\nwe're trying to start won't be enough but they'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"We been yellin' for help to the CDT, over on Ivory,\" said Potter. \"But\nyou know these Embassy stooges.\"\n  \n \n  \"We heard they were sending some kind of bureaucrat in here to tell\nus to get out and give the oases to the Flap-jacks,\" said Swazey. He\ntightened his mouth. \"We're waitin' for him....\"\n  \n \n  \"Meanwhile we got reinforcements comin' up, eh, boys?\" Bert winked at\nRetief. \"We put out the word back home. We all got relatives on Ivory\nand Verde.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, you damn fool!\" a deep voice grated.\n  \n \n  \"Lemuel!\" Potter said. \"Nobody else could sneak up on us like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"If I'd a been a Flap-jack; I'd of et you alive,\" the newcomer said,\nmoving into the ring of fire, a tall, broad-faced man in grimy leather.\nHe eyed Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Who's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do ya mean?\" Potter spoke in the silence. \"He's your cousin....\"\n  \n \n  \"He ain't no cousin of mine,\" Lemuel said slowly. He stepped to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Who you spyin' for, stranger?\" he rasped.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_2]\nThe mail pilot, a leathery veteran with quarter-inch whiskers, spat\ntoward a stained corner of the compartment, leaned close to the screen.\n  \n \n  \"They's shootin' goin' on down there,\" he said. \"See them white puffs\nover the edge of the desert?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm supposed to be preventing the war,\" said Retief. \"It looks like\nI'm a little late.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot's head snapped around. \"War?\" he yelped. \"Nobody told me they\nwas a war goin' on on 'Dobe. If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out of\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.\"\n  \n \n  \"They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance.\" He started\npunching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief\nblocked casually. \"Are you nuts?\" the pilot screeched. \"They's plenty\nshootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.\"\n  \n \n  \"The mail must go through, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'll\ntell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a pal. I'll take your offer.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot jumped to the lifeboat hatch and cycled it open. \"Get in.\nWe're closin' fast. Them birds might take it into their heads to lob\none this way....\"\n  \n \n  Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over the\ncontrols. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a\nheavy old-fashioned power pistol. \"Long as you're goin' in, might as\nwell take this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks.\" Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. \"I hope you're wrong.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over—one way or another.\"\n  \n \n  The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiff\ndropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the\ndeparting mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the\nmanual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....\n  \n \n  A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.\n  \n \n  Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy\nradiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed\nbut by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a\nhigh trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....\n  \n \n  Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.\n  \n \n  He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This\nwas going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief\nthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the\noncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,\ncorrecting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no\nmore than 1000 yards.\n  \n \n  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past\nthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining\nharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and\nharmless.\n  \n \n  Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.\nRetief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on\nits back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series of\nshocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by the\nping of hot metal contracting.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_10]\nConsul Passwyn glanced up at Retief, went on perusing a paper.\n  \n \n  \"Sit down, Retief,\" he said absently. \"I thought you were over on\nPueblo, or Mud-flat, or whatever they call that desert.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm back.\"\n  \n \n  Passwyn eyed him sharply. \"Well, well, what is it you need, man?

This interest is reflected in all of the Jaq's interactions with Retief, including his ability to be coerced into hand-to-hand combat because he deems it a more modern, sportsmanlike way of resolving issues. Wine again becomes important after Retief wins the fight and gets Hoshick to agree to the terms of his proposed land treaty with the Terrestrials. After Hoshick agrees, Retief attempts to convince the Terrestrials to agree as well. After learning of the lack of wine within their settlements, Retief lets the Terrestrials sample the wine provided to him by the Jaq. Eventually, the Terrestrials agree to the arrangement as well. Therefore, the wine is also a symbol of the newfound peace between the two previously warring groups.", "The Jaqs make their own wine out of the lichens that they grow in the desert. The lichens will only grow in the desert, so the desert is extremely important to them. Their wine is of very high quality; in fact, Retief compares it to the wine from Chateau d’Yquem. The wine helps Retief arrange the deal to divide the land between the settlers and Jaqs in a way that is favorable to both sides. The human settlers have not been able to produce wine; they believe that the bacteria required to make it won’t grow on Yaq, so they have only been drinking stump water. Retief lets them try the Jaqs' wine, and they like it. This, along with the offer to give all of the deserts to the Jaqs and keep all of the oases for the humans, helps Retief work out the peace deal for the Jaqs and the settlers. \n", "Wine is significant in the story because it symbolizes how little the Jaqs and the Terrestrials know about one another, and how they can live harmoniously. The Terrestrials believe that Adobe is lethal to the process of making alcohol and that wine can’t be made. The Jaqs enjoy a sweet yellow wine made from lichens that they get from the desert. Retief settles the dispute with the Jaqs over wine, and then brings some with him to settle it with the Terrestrials, and both parties agree. The wine is a symbol of how their differing aims can complement each other and they can produce and trade different crops to benefit everyone. \n", "Wine is an important part of the story because the Flap-jacks have only come to Adobe to make their wine. The leader of the Flap-jacks, Hoshick, explains that he brought his people to the planet to build his own Mosaic and till the sands to grow paradise-lichen. He hoped to make delicious and expensive wine with the crop and sell it all over the universe. \n\nRetief tries the wine during his conversation with Hoshick, and he compares the beverage to Chateau d'Yquem. When he takes some back to his men, they also find the wine to be wonderful. \n\nIf the Terrestrials had known in the beginning that the Flap-jacks were interested in harvesting the lichens in the sand, they never would have tried to engage in battle with them.\n"]}}

By the faint\nlight he could just make out the towering figure of the Flap-jack\nrearing up before him, his trappings gone. A silent rank of Flap-jack\nretainers were grouped behind him.\n  \n \n  \"I fear I must lay aside the translator now, Retief,\" said Hoshick.\nHe sighed and rippled his fringe tentacles. \"My spawn-fellows will\nnever credit this.

But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to\neven it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Very well. Shall we begin?\"\n  \n \n  With a rush Hoshick threw himself at Retief, who ducked, whirled, and\nleaped on the Flap-jack's back ... and felt himself flipped clear by\na mighty ripple of the alien's slab-like body. Retief rolled aside\nas Hoshick turned on him; he jumped to his feet and threw a right\nhay-maker to Hoshick's mid-section. The alien whipped his left fringe\naround in an arc that connected with Retief's jaw, sent him spinning\nonto his back ... and Hoshick's weight struck him.\n  \n \n \n \n  Retief twisted, tried to roll. The flat body of the alien blanketed\nhim. He worked an arm free, drumming blows on the leathery back.\nHoshick nestled closer.\n  \n \n  Retief's air was running out. He heaved up against the smothering\nweight. Nothing budged.\n  \n \n  It was like burial under a dump-truck-load of concrete.\n  \n \n  He remembered the rangerform he had captured. The sensitive orifice\nhad been placed ventrally, in what would be the thoracic area....\n  \n \n  He groped, felt tough hide set with horny granules. He would be missing\nskin tomorrow ... if there was a tomorrow. His thumb found the orifice\nand probed.\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack recoiled. Retief held fast, probed deeper, groping with\nthe other hand. If the alien were bilaterally symmetrical there would\nbe a set of ready made hand-holds....\n\n[Chapter: CALL_HIM_NEMESIS_6]\nYou don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political\nconnections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As\nCaptain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both\nmore imaginative than most—\"You gotta be able to second-guess the\nsmart boys\"—and to be a complete realist—\"You gotta have both feet\non the ground.\" If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was\nbest not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.\n  \n \n  The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.\n\"Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?\" he demanded.\n  \n \n  \"I'm not sure,\" admitted Stevenson. \"But we've got these two things.\nFirst, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for\nno reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk.\nThen, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle\nall of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to\nprove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.\"\n  \n \n  \"He says he put that on there himself,\" said the captain.\n  \n \n  Stevenson shook his head. \"His\n   \n   lawyer\n   \n  says he put it on there.\nHiggins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer's\ncase. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.\"\n  \n \n  \"He put it on there himself, Stevenson,\" said the captain with weary\npatience. \"What are you trying to prove?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And\nwhat about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?\"\n  \n \n  \"They were defective,\" said Hanks promptly.\n  \n \n  \"All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the\ntrunk?\"\n  \n \n  \"How do I know?\" demanded the captain. \"Kids put it on before the car\nwas stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows?\nWhat do\n   \n   they\n   \n  say?\"\n  \n \n  \"They say they didn't do it,\" said Stevenson. \"And they say they never\nsaw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been\nthere.\"\n  \n \n  The captain shook his head. \"I don't get it,\" he admitted. \"What are\nyou trying to prove?\"\n  \n \n  \"I guess,\" said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, \"I\nguess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made\nthat rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.\"\n  \n \n  \"What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What are\nyou trying to hand me?\"\n  \n \n  \"All I know,\" insisted Stevenson, \"is what I see.\"\n  \n \n  \"And all\n   \n   I\n   \n  know,\" the captain told him, \"is Higgins put that name on\nhis rifle himself.

What do\nyou\n   \n   think\n   \n  made it hot?\"\n  \n \n  \"All of a sudden?\"\n  \n \n  \"He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.\"\n  \n \n  \"How come the same name showed up each time, then?\" Stevenson asked\ndesperately.\n  \n \n  \"How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do these\nthings happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and they\nwrite 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happens\nall the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?\"\n  \n \n  \"But there's no explanation—\" started Stevenson.\n  \n \n  \"What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just\n   \n   gave\n   \n  you the\nexplanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty\nidea—like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there\nwas a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned\nrefrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting\nall upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch.\nRemember?\"\n  \n \n  \"I remember,\" said Stevenson.\n  \n \n  \"Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson,\" the captain advised him.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, sir,\" said Stevenson....\n  \n \n  The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a\ncrank letter to the\n   \n   Daily News\n   \n  :\n  \n \n  Dear Mr. Editor,\n  \n \n  You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people could\nnot escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal is\nsafe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS.\n  \n \n  Sincerely yours,\n   \n  THE SCORPION\n  \n \n  Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had\nseen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the\nsame place, and forgotten.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around\nfor the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up\ncarrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on\nyour way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a\nJD.\n  \n \n  The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances\non two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and\nthe street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides\nclaimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys\nfrom both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that\nhad been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and\ndetermined that the matter could only be settled in a war.\n  \n \n  The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard.\nThe weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no\npistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner\nwould have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both\nentrances.\n  \n \n  The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate\nclubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play\nchicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of\nthe approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might\ncome wandering through.\n  \n \n  Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen\nyears old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine,\ngum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the\nScarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to\nher. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.\n  \n \n  Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were\ndark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark,\nparticularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone\npole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet\nRaider jacket and waited.\n  \n \n  At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The\nrumble had started.\n  \n \n  At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the\nstreet. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them\ncarried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks\non.\n  \n \n  They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, \"Hey,\nyou kids. Take off.\"\n  \n \n  One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. \"Who, us?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.\"\n  \n \n  \"The subway's this way,\" objected the kid in the red mask.\n  \n \n  \"Who cares? You go around the other way.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_4]\nRetief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain—\"\n  \n \n  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n  \n \n  \"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n  \n \n  \"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\n  \n \n  Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n  \n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n  \n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n  \n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire—\n  \n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n  \n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n  \n \n  \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's the idea...?\"\n  \n \n  \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_9]\nThere were.\n  \n \n  Retief dug in and the Flap-jack writhed, pulled away. Retief held on,\nscrambled to his feet, threw his weight against the alien and fell on\ntop of him, still gouging. Hoshick rippled his fringe wildly, flopped\nin terror, then went limp.\n  \n \n  Retief relaxed, released his hold and got to his feet, breathing hard.\nHoshick humped himself over onto his ventral side, lifted and moved\ngingerly over to the sidelines. His retainers came forward, assisted\nhim into his trappings, strapped on the translator. He sighed heavily,\nadjusted the volume.\n  \n \n  \"There is much to be said for the old system,\" he said. \"What a burden\none's sportsmanship places on one at times.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great sport, wasn't it?\" said Retief. \"Now, I know you'll be eager to\ncontinue. If you'll just wait while I run back and fetch some of our\ngougerforms—\"\n  \n \n  \"May hide-ticks devour the gougerforms!\" Hoshick bellowed. \"You've\ngiven me such a sprong-ache as I'll remember each spawning-time for a\nyear.\"\n  \n \n  \"Speaking of hide-ticks,\" said Retief, \"we've developed a biterform—\"\n  \n \n  \"Enough!\" Hoshick roared, so loudly that the translator bounced on his\nhide. \"Suddenly I yearn for the crowded yellow sands of Jaq. I had\nhoped....\" He broke off, drew a rasping breath. \"I had hoped, Retief,\"\nhe said, speaking sadly now, \"to find a new land here where I might\nplan my own Mosaic, till these alien sands and bring forth such a crop\nof paradise-lichen as should glut the markets of a hundred worlds. But\nmy spirit is not equal to the prospect of biterforms and gougerforms\nwithout end. I am shamed before you....\"\n  \n \n  \"To tell you the truth, I'm old-fashioned myself. I'd rather watch the\naction from a distance too.\"\n  \n \n  \"But surely your spawn-fellows would never condone such an attitude.\"\n  \n \n  \"My spawn-fellows aren't here. And besides, didn't I mention it? No\none who's really in the know would think of engaging in competition by\nmere combat if there were any other way. Now, you mentioned tilling the\nsand, raising lichens—things like that—\"\n  \n \n  \"That on which we dined but now,\" said Hoshick, \"and from which the\nwine is made.\"\n  \n \n  \"The big news in fashionable diplomacy today is farming competition.\nNow, if you'd like to take these deserts and raise lichen, we'll\npromise to stick to the oases and vegetables.\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick curled his back in attention. \"Retief, you're quite serious?\nYou would leave all the fair sand hills to us?\"\n  \n \n  \"The whole works, Hoshick. I'll take the oases.\"\n  \n \n  Hoshick rippled his fringes ecstatically. \"Once again you have outdone\nme, Retief,\" he cried. \"This time, in generosity.\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll talk over the details later. I'm sure we can establish a set of\nrules that will satisfy all parties. Now I've got to get back. I think\nsome of the gougerforms are waiting to see me.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  It was nearly dawn when Retief gave the whistled signal he had agreed\non with Potter, then rose and walked into the camp circle. Swazey stood\nup.\n  \n \n  \"There you are,\" he said. \"We been wonderin' whether to go out after\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel came forward, one eye black to the cheekbone. He held out a\nraw-boned hand. \"Sorry I jumped you, stranger. Tell you the truth, I\nthought you was some kind of stool-pigeon from the CDT.\"\n  \n \n  Bert came up behind Lemuel. \"How do you know he ain't, Lemuel?\" he\nsaid. \"Maybe he—\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel floored Bert with a backward sweep of his arm. \"Next\ncotton-picker says some embassy Johnny can cool me gets worse'n that.\"\n  \n \n  \"Tell me,\" said Retief. \"How are you boys fixed for wine?\"\n  \n \n  \"Wine? Mister, we been livin' on stump water for a year now. 'Dobe's\nfatal to the kind of bacteria it takes to ferment likker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Try this.\" Retief handed over a sqat jug. Swazey drew the cork,\nsniffed, drank and passed it to Lemuel.\n  \n \n  \"Mister, where'd you get that?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Flap-jacks make it. Here's another question for you: Would you\nconcede a share in this planet to the Flap-jacks in return for a peace\nguarantee?\"\n  \n \n  At the end of a half hour of heated debate Lemuel turned to Retief.\n\"We'll make any reasonable deal,\" he said. \"I guess they got as much\nright here as we have. I think we'd agree to a fifty-fifty split.\nThat'd give about a hundred and fifty oases to each side.\"\n  \n \n  \"What would you say to keeping all the oases and giving them the\ndesert?\"\n  \n \n  Lemuel reached for the wine jug, eyes on Retief. \"Keep talkin',\nmister,\" he said. \"I think you got yourself a deal.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_3]\nCoughing, Retief disengaged himself from the shock-webbing. He beat\nout sparks in his lap, groped underfoot for the hatch and wrenched it\nopen. A wave of hot jungle air struck him. He lowered himself to a bed\nof shattered foliage, got to his feet ... and dropped flat as a bullet\nwhined past his ear.\n  \n \n  He lay listening. Stealthy movements were audible from the left.\n  \n \n  He inched his way to the shelter of a broad-boled dwarf tree. Somewhere\na song lizard burbled. Whining insects circled, scented alien life,\nbuzzed off. There was another rustle of foliage from the underbrush\nfive yards away. A bush quivered, then a low bough dipped.\n  \n \n  Retief edged back around the trunk, eased down behind a fallen log.\nA stocky man in grimy leather shirt and shorts appeared, moving\ncautiously, a pistol in his hand.\n  \n \n  As he passed, Retief rose, leaped the log and tackled him.\n  \n \n  They went down together. The stranger gave one short yell, then\nstruggled in silence. Retief flipped him onto his back, raised a fist—\n  \n \n  \"Hey!\" the settler yelled. \"You're as human as I am!\"\n  \n \n  \"Maybe I'll look better after a shave,\" said Retief. \"What's the idea\nof shooting at me?\"\n  \n \n  \"Lemme up. My name's Potter. Sorry 'bout that. I figured it was a\nFlap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something\nmove. Didn't know it was a Terrestrial. Who are you? What you doin'\nhere? We're pretty close to the edge of the oases. That's Flap-jack\ncountry over there.\" He waved a hand toward the north, where the desert\nlay.\n  \n \n  \"I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Missile, eh? Must be Flap-jack artillery. We got nothing like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"I heard there was a full-fledged war brewing,\" said Retief. \"I didn't\nexpect—\"\n  \n \n  \"Good!\" Potter said. \"We figured a few of you boys from Ivory would be\njoining up when you heard. You are from Ivory?\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes. I'm—\"\n  \n \n  \"Hey, you must be Lemuel's cousin. Good night! I pretty near made a bad\nmistake. Lemuel's a tough man to explain something to.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm—\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep your head down. These damn Flap-jacks have got some wicked hand\nweapons. Come on....\" He moved off silently on all fours. Retief\nfollowed. They crossed two hundred yards of rough country before Potter\ngot to his feet, took out a soggy bandana and mopped his face.\n  \n \n  \"You move good for a city man. I thought you folks on Ivory just sat\nunder those domes and read dials. But I guess bein' Lemuel's cousin you\nwas raised different.\"\n  \n \n  \"As a matter of fact—\"\n  \n \n  \"Have to get you some real clothes, though. Those city duds don't stand\nup on 'Dobe.\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked down at the charred, torn and sweat-soaked powder-blue\nblazer and slacks.\n  \n \n  \"This outfit seemed pretty rough-and-ready back home,\" he said. \"But I\nguess leather has its points.\"\n  \n \n  \"Let's get on back to camp. We'll just about make it by sundown.\nAnd, look. Don't say anything to Lemuel about me thinking you were a\nFlap-jack.\"\n  \n \n  \"I won't, but—\"\n  \n \n  Potter was on his way, loping off up a gentle slope. Retief pulled off\nthe sodden blazer, dropped it over a bush, added his string tie and\nfollowed Potter.\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  \"We're damn glad you're here, mister,\" said a fat man with two\nrevolvers belted across his paunch. \"We can use every hand. We're in\nbad shape. We ran into the Flap-jacks three months ago and we haven't\nmade a smart move since. First, we thought they were a native form we\nhadn't run into before. Fact is, one of the boys shot one, thinkin' it\nwas fair game. I guess that was the start of it.\" He stirred the fire,\nadded a stick.\n  \n \n  \"And then a bunch of 'em hit Swazey's farm here,\" Potter said. \"Killed\ntwo of his cattle, and pulled back.\"\n  \n \n  \"I figure they thought the cows were people,\" said Swazey. \"They were\nout for revenge.\"\n  \n \n  \"How could anybody think a cow was folks?\" another man put in. \"They\ndon't look nothin' like—\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't be so dumb, Bert,\" said Swazey. \"They'd never seen Terries\nbefore. They know better now.\"\n  \n \n  Bert chuckled. \"Sure do. We showed 'em the next time, didn't we,\nPotter? Got four.\"\n  \n \n  \"They walked right up to my place a couple days after the first time,\"\nSwazey said. \"We were ready for 'em. Peppered 'em good. They cut and\nrun.\"\n  \n \n  \"Flopped, you mean. Ugliest lookin' critters you ever saw. Look just\nlike a old piece of dirty blanket humpin' around.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's been goin' on this way ever since. They raid and then we raid.\nBut lately they've been bringing some big stuff into it. They've got\nsome kind of pint-sized airships and automatic rifles.

The colony's got less than three hundred able-bodied\nmen.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we're hanging onto our farms,\" said Potter. \"All these oases are\nold sea-beds—a mile deep, solid topsoil. And there's a couple of\nhundred others we haven't touched yet. The Flap-jacks won't get 'em\nwhile there's a man alive.\"\n  \n \n  \"The whole system needs the food we can raise,\" Bert said. \"These farms\nwe're trying to start won't be enough but they'll help.\"\n  \n \n  \"We been yellin' for help to the CDT, over on Ivory,\" said Potter. \"But\nyou know these Embassy stooges.\"\n  \n \n  \"We heard they were sending some kind of bureaucrat in here to tell\nus to get out and give the oases to the Flap-jacks,\" said Swazey. He\ntightened his mouth. \"We're waitin' for him....\"\n  \n \n  \"Meanwhile we got reinforcements comin' up, eh, boys?\" Bert winked at\nRetief. \"We put out the word back home. We all got relatives on Ivory\nand Verde.\"\n  \n \n  \"Shut up, you damn fool!\" a deep voice grated.\n  \n \n  \"Lemuel!\" Potter said. \"Nobody else could sneak up on us like that.\"\n  \n \n  \"If I'd a been a Flap-jack; I'd of et you alive,\" the newcomer said,\nmoving into the ring of fire, a tall, broad-faced man in grimy leather.\nHe eyed Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Who's that?\"\n  \n \n  \"What do ya mean?\" Potter spoke in the silence. \"He's your cousin....\"\n  \n \n  \"He ain't no cousin of mine,\" Lemuel said slowly. He stepped to Retief.\n  \n \n  \"Who you spyin' for, stranger?\" he rasped.\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_6]\nTwenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart\nof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry\nforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n  \n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n  \n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears—or no ears at all—but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n  \n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n  \n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n  \n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n  \n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n  \n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n  \n \n  \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n  \n \n  \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n  \n \n  \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n  \n \n  \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n  \n \n  \"Delighted.\"\n  \n \n  Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n  \n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit—\"\n  \n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n  \n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n  \n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n  \n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n  \n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n  \n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n  \n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n  \n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n  \n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n  \n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n  \n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder.

Curious. What forms are those?\"\n  \n \n  \"Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, but\nlacking in caste.

Most considerate of you to\npoint it out.\" Hoshick clucked in dismay. \"I see that skirmishforms are\nmuch the same among you as with us: lacking in perception.\" He laughed\nscratchily. \"Imagine considering us as—what was the word?—varmints.\"\n  \n \n  \"Which brings us to the crux of the matter.

You and me.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_5]\nFive minutes' stealthy progress brought him to a slight rise of ground.\nWith infinite caution he raised himself, risking a glance over an\nout-cropping of rock.\n  \n \n  The stunted trees ended just ahead. Beyond, he could make out the dim\ncontour of rolling desert. Flap-jack country. He got to his feet,\nclambered over the stone—still hot after a day of tropical heat—and\nmoved forward twenty yards. Around him he saw nothing but drifted sand,\npalely visible in the starlight, and the occasional shadow of jutting\nshale slabs. Behind him the jungle was still.\n  \n \n  He sat down on the ground to wait.\n  \n \n  It was ten minutes before a movement caught his eye. Something had\nseparated itself from a dark mass of stone, glided across a few yards\nof open ground to another shelter. Retief watched. Minutes passed. The\nshape moved again, slipped into a shadow ten feet distant. Retief felt\nthe butt of the power pistol with his elbow. His guess had better be\nright this time....\n  \n \n  There was a sudden rasp, like leather against concrete, and a flurry of\nsand as the Flap-jack charged.\n  \n \n  Retief rolled aside, then lunged, threw his weight on the flopping\nFlap-jack—a yard square, three inches thick at the center and all\nmuscle. The ray-like creature heaved up, curled backward, its edge\nrippling, to stand on the flattened rim of its encircling sphincter.\nIt scrabbled with prehensile fringe-tentacles for a grip on Retief's\nshoulders. He wrapped his arms around the alien and struggled to his\nfeet. The thing was heavy. A hundred pounds at least. Fighting as it\nwas, it seemed more like five hundred.\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack reversed its tactics, went limp. Retief grabbed, felt a\nthumb slip into an orifice—\n  \n \n  The alien went wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper.\n  \n \n  \"Sorry, fellow,\" he muttered between clenched teeth. \"Eye-gouging isn't\ngentlemanly, but it's effective....\"\n  \n \n  The Flap-jack fell still, only its fringes rippling slowly. Retief\nrelaxed the pressure of his thumb; the alien gave a tentative jerk; the\nthumb dug in.\n  \n \n  The alien went limp again, waiting.\n  \n \n  \"Now we understand each other,\" said Retief. \"Take me to your leader.\"\n\n[Chapter: RETIEF_OF_THE_RED-TAPE_MOUNTAIN_2]\nThe mail pilot, a leathery veteran with quarter-inch whiskers, spat\ntoward a stained corner of the compartment, leaned close to the screen.\n  \n \n  \"They's shootin' goin' on down there,\" he said. \"See them white puffs\nover the edge of the desert?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm supposed to be preventing the war,\" said Retief. \"It looks like\nI'm a little late.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot's head snapped around. \"War?\" he yelped. \"Nobody told me they\nwas a war goin' on on 'Dobe. If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out of\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.\"\n  \n \n  \"They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance.\" He started\npunching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist.\n  \n \n  \"Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief\nblocked casually. \"Are you nuts?\" the pilot screeched. \"They's plenty\nshootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.\"\n  \n \n  \"The mail must go through, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'll\ntell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.\"\n  \n \n  \"You're a pal. I'll take your offer.\"\n  \n \n  The pilot jumped to the lifeboat hatch and cycled it open. \"Get in.\nWe're closin' fast. Them birds might take it into their heads to lob\none this way....\"\n  \n \n  Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over the\ncontrols. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a\nheavy old-fashioned power pistol. \"Long as you're goin' in, might as\nwell take this.\"\n  \n \n  \"Thanks.\" Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. \"I hope you're wrong.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over—one way or another.\"\n  \n \n  The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiff\ndropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the\ndeparting mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the\nmanual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....\n  \n \n  A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.\n  \n \n  Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy\nradiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed\nbut by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a\nhigh trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....\n  \n \n  Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.\n  \n \n  He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This\nwas going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief\nthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the\noncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,\ncorrecting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no\nmore than 1000 yards.\n  \n \n  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past\nthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining\nharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and\nharmless.\n  \n \n  Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.\nRetief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark.

Thanks to a swift maneuver, Retief is able to dodge its impact and crash-lands on Adobe. However, due to the red blip on his radar screen, Retief is now aware that one of the warring groups on the planet is using illegal fission weapons in battle. Initially, he believes the Terrestrials were responsible for this, but after meeting Potter, he realizes his mistake. Potter informs him the Terrestrials do not have weapons of that kind, so it has to be Jaq weaponry. This information becomes important later when Retief meets Hoshick for the first time. As the leader of the Jaq, Hoshick informs Retief that the skirmishes were a result of a desire to engage in more sportsmanlike conduct on the battlefield. Retief realizes he can use this desire to his advantage and pushes Hoshick to question whether or not weapons are required at all in resolving conflict. He pushes this idea further by suggesting his own kind would never solve problems with weapons, despite one of the Jaqs having been previously shot down by them. Retief excuses this by again playing into Hoshick's desire to appear more dignified and saying the shooting was a failure to recognize the Jaq as sportsmen. This tactic works, and he is able to use it to convince Hoshick to engage in hand-to-hand combat, which eventually leads to the resolution of the war.", "The fission weapon is an indication of the intelligence and resources of the Jaqs, although at first, Retief doesn’t know whose weapon it is. The fission weapon tracks the object it seeks and follows it. Retief is only able to avoid colliding with it by flying straight toward it at the last minute and passing it before it explodes. The leader of the Jaqs, Hoshick, says that he would prefer a contest without nuclear or radiation-effect weapons because it is such a bore having to screen the spawn for deviations afterward. Retief readily agrees that the humans will not use atomic weapons either for the same reason and because it wastes troops. This agreement is the first concession by the Jaqs and the humans about the fighting and is followed by other concessions that are advantageous to both sides.", "The fission weapon is significant in the story for a few reasons. It nearly takes down the aircraft that Retief is flying to Adobe. He later finds out that the Jaqs have been using them in order to give the Terrestrials a good show of strength, and that their nuclear/radiation effect has spawned more creatures, such as the one that Retief briefly takes captive. The Terrestrials tell Retief that they don’t have access to such weapons and that the Jaqs have been leveling up their weaponry; unbeknownst to them, the Jaqs have done so to try to compete with them. \n", "The fission weapon is important because it almost kills Retief.\n\nRetief encounters the fission weapon when he is piloting the skiff alone towards Adobe. His original pilot refuses to transport him to the planet because he can see that there are missiles and other weapons in use. The pilot does not want to get killed, and he insists that Retief can die if that’s what he wants to do.\n\nWhile Retief is flying towards Adobe, he sees a red blip show up on the screen of the skiff. Retief feels nervous and panicky because the red dot means that someone has deployed a warhead that emits heavy radiation, also known as a fission weapon. The fission weapon has been outlawed. He hopes that his skiff has not been spotted, and he changes course to avoid the warhead. When the missile comes within five miles of his vehicle, Retief decides to accelerate as fast as possible. He just makes it past the missile, and it explodes mid-air. The fission weapon makes Retief crash land on the planet. His skiff fills with smoke and his screen breaks. \n"]}}

The column halted with a clash of accoutrements\nand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high\nwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,\nbutts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.\n  \n \n  \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the\nidea has merit.\"\n  \n \n  The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired\nwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat\nstepped out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt\nto get you out of this.\"\n  \n \n  He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at\nthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong—and beyond, at\nthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.\n  \n \n  \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking\nup at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I\nassume?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly.\n  \n \n  \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate\nHeadquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This—\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release,\" Nitworth\nhissed over his shoulder. \"Now—\"\n  \n \n  \"You will address our leader with more respect!\" the tall Qornt hooted,\neyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about the\ninvasion—\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped.\nHe rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to\nevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested—\"\n  \n \n  \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.\nInstructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow any\nother instructions you might have.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said.\n\"This isn't—\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence, confound you!\" Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structure\nwould provide the element of novelty the Department has requested\nin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma of\nTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_1]\nMIGHTIEST QORN\n  \n \n  BY KEITH LAUMER\n  \n \n  Sly, brave and truculent, the Qornt\n   \n  held all humans in contempt—except one!\n  \n \n  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n   \n  Worlds of If Science Fiction, July 1963.\n   \n  Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n   \n  the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n  \n \n \n  I\n  \n \n  Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot\nplatinum desk at his assembled staff.\n  \n \n  \"Gentlemen, are any of you familiar with a race known as the Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  There was a moment of profound silence. Nitworth leaned forward,\nlooking solemn.\n  \n \n  \"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat\ntimes, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as\nthey had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused\nfor effect.\n  \n \n  \"They have now reappeared—occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n  \n \n  \"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited\nTerrestrial territory....\"\n  \n \n  \"Indeed, Mr. Magnan?\" Nitworth smiled icily. \"It appears the Qornt do\nnot share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder\nbefore him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n  \n \n  His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the\nGalactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the\npresence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor\nto advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the\nthirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive,\nTerrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence,\nand let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n  \n \n  \"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n  \n \n  Nitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n  \n \n  \"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out—\" the Military Attache\nbegan.\n  \n \n  \"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on\nthe surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested\nfrowns to settle into place.\n  \n \n  \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial\ncontrolled soil—and without so much as a flicker from the instruments\nof the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n  \n \n  The Military Attache blinked. \"That's absurd,\" he said flatly. Nitworth\nslapped the table.\n  \n \n  \"We're up against something new, gentlemen! I've considered every\nhypothesis from cloaks of invisibility to time travel! The fact is—the\nQornt fleets are indetectible!\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_3]\n\"Those undoubtedly are the most bloodthirsty, aggressive, merciless\ncountenances it has ever been my misfortune to encounter,\" Magnan said.\n\"It hardly seems fair. Eight feet tall\n   \n   and\n   \n  faces like that!\"\n  \n \n  The smaller of the two captive Qornt ran long, slender fingers over\na bony shin, from which he had turned back the tight-fitting green\ntrousers.\n  \n \n  \"It's not broken,\" he whistled nasally in passable Terrestrial, eyeing\nMagnan through the heavy goggles, now badly cracked. \"Small thanks to\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan smiled loftily. \"I daresay you'll think twice before interfering\nwith peaceable diplomats in future.\"\n  \n \n  \"Diplomats? Surely you jest.\"\n  \n \n  \"Never mind us,\" Retief said. \"It's you fellows we'd like to talk\nabout. How many of you are there?\"\n  \n \n  \"Only Zubb and myself.\"\n  \n \n  \"I mean altogether. How many Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  The alien whistled shrilly.\n  \n \n  \"Here, no signalling!\" Magnan snapped, looking around.\n  \n \n  \"That was merely an expression of amusement.\"\n  \n \n  \"You find the situation amusing? I assure you, sir, you are in perilous\nstraits at the moment. I\n   \n   may\n   \n  fly into another rage, you know.\"\n  \n \n  \"Please, restrain yourself. I was merely somewhat astonished—\" a small\nwhistle escaped—\"at being taken for a Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"Aren't you a Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  \"I? Great snail trails, no!\" More stifled whistles of amusement escaped\nthe beaked face. \"Both Zubb and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it\nhappens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You certainly\n   \n   look\n   \n  like Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, not at all—except perhaps to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are\nsturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course,\nthey do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n  \n \n  \"A caste? You mean they're biologically the same as you?\"\n  \n \n  \"Not at all!

One dreads to contemplate descending to\n   \n   their\n   \n  level.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you know anything about a Note passed to the Terrestrial Ambassador\nat Smorbrod?\" Retief asked.\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_4]\nThe beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n  \n \n  \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n  \n \n  \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n  \n \n  \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum—unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating—such a tedious business—and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne—who\nopenly avow their occupied world—would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun—Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush—\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope—\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions—\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk—\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely—\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_8]\nMagnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And\ndid you notice the size of those hands?\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that phenomenal reach—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,\nI'll get a crack at him.\"\n  \n \n  Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n  \n \n  \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n  \n \n  Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens—both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt—formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\n  \n \n  Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg—and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\n  \n \n  Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\n  \n \n  Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n  \n \n  \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your\nweapons, Zubb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   may\n   \n  lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\n  \n \n  Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n  \n \n  \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n  \n \n  The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications—\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we must select a leader!\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_7]\nThere was a momentary silence from all sides.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with\nflame-colored plumes.\n  \n \n  Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he\nbassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I\nthought I'd made my point!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm convinced.\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's\nus.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not\nconvinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the\ntable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants\nanyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration—\"\n  \n \n  \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"\nHe belched again.\n  \n \n  A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a\ncrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped\nthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n  \n \n  \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.\nFour loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around\nthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the\nends and closed it.\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a\nbit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n  \n \n  \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:\nwe carve them up a little—lop off the external labiae and pinnae,\nsay—and ship them back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending\nus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n  \n \n  \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"\nRetief commented.\n  \n \n  \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a\nreasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that\nthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"\nhe hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.\n\"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can\nassure you, it's useless. We Qornt\n   \n   like\n   \n  to fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"\nRetief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver\nan Ultimatum.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n  \n \n  \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new\ntype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in\nseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of\nQornt Hall—uninvited, at that—and in chains—\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links\nstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like\nto go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead\nyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I—\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n  \n \n  \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n  \n \n  Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"\nhe honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n  \n \n  \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers\nwith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But—\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in\nbattle! We live in fame or go down in—\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,\nwe could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to\nprove anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the\nrest of the boys would listen to reason—\"\n  \n \n  \"Over my dead body!\"\n  \n \n  \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in\nthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the\nfloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_6]\nRetief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol\nin one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at\nMagnan's chest.\n  \n \n  \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n  \n \n  \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy\nof the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp\nhave been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's\nanything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now\nstep along, please.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief\nstepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at\nthe head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,\nstaring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,\nfollowed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table\nfaded.\n  \n \n  Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped\nforward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his\nchair—a low, heavily padded stool—and stared unwinking at Retief,\nmoving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to\nbear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy\nhair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned\nface, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz\nsurrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress\nof scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of\npink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n  \n \n  Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n  \n \n  Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n  \n \n  \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match\nbetween you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,\nbut he's got timbre.\"\n  \n \n  \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or\nSmorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?\nA compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the\ntable. \"The answer is\n   \n   no\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that\none.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;\nyou'd best chain him, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, your Excellency—\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n  \n \n  \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered—\"\n  \n \n  \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I\ndon't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!\nI want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the\ntable. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_11]\nOutside in the corridor, Magnan came up to Retief, who stood talking to\na tall man in a pilot's coverall.\n  \n \n  \"I'll be tied up, sending through full details on my—our—your\nrecruiting theme, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Suppose you run into the city\nto assist the new Verpp Consul in settling in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that, Mr. Magnan. Anything else?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan raised his eyebrows. \"You're remarkably compliant today, Retief.\nI'll arrange transportation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother, Mr. Magnan. Cy here will run me over. He was the pilot\nwho ferried us over to Roolit I, you recall.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll be with you as soon as I pack a few phone numbers, Retief,\" the\npilot said. He moved off. Magnan followed him with a disapproving eye.\n\"An uncouth sort, I fancied. I trust you're not consorting with his\nkind socially.\"\n  \n \n  \"I wouldn't say that, exactly,\" Retief said. \"We just want to go over a\nfew figures together.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_2]\nThe Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't\ntry conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive\nof our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the\nConfidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a\ncouple of volunteers with plastic beaks—\"\n  \n \n  \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be\nworked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will\nbe a holding action.

Any\nrecommendation?\"\n  \n \n  The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a\nstiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n  \n \n  \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,\ndignified, aggressive withdrawal—as soon as possible.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military\nAttache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal—say, until tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of\naction is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population\nof over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the\nPolitical Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk\nby oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.\nHarried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan\neased toward the door.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n  \n \n  \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It\nwas a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to\nlet us know how it works out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of\nchores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field\nexperience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these\nQornt personally.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n  \n \n  \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my\nhead and do something rash if I go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.\nNo dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the\ntransport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n  \n \n  Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves—in any\ndirection.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope\nof towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among\nflamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of\nwhite beach with the blue sea beyond.\n  \n \n  \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we\ncouldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why\ndon't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can\nobserve.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to\nthink of sightseeing.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're\nquestioning Corps policy!\"\n  \n \n  \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it\nmight be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm\nnot back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n  \n \n  \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's directly down-slope—\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan\nclutched at his arm.\n  \n \n  There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy\nbranch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,\ngreen-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like\nsteps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set\namong bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed\nas the creature cocked its head, listening.\n  \n \n  Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed\ndirectly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of\na giant trunk.\n  \n \n  \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps\ninto the brush.\n  \n \n  A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,\ndarted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its\nnarrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,\nturned—and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the\nright. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n  \n \n  Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and\nstopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n  \n \n  \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of\nthem.\"\n\n[Chapter: THE_MADMAN_FROM_EARTH_2]\n\"I wrote them for you. They're just as Consul Whaffle would have wanted\nthem.\"\n  \n \n  \"Did you write all Whaffle's letters for him, Miss Meuhl?\"\n  \n \n  \"Consul Whaffle was an extremely busy man,\" Miss Meuhl said stiffly.\n\"He had complete confidence in me.\"\n  \n \n  \"Since I'm cutting out the culture from now on,\" Retief said, \"I won't\nbe so busy.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well!\" Miss Meuhl said. \"May I ask where you'll be if something comes\nup?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm going over to the Foreign Office Archives.\"\n  \n \n  Miss Meuhl blinked behind thick lenses. \"Whatever for?\"\n  \n \n  Retief looked thoughtfully at Miss Meuhl. \"You've been here on Groac\nfor four years, Miss Meuhl. What was behind the coup d'etat that put\nthe present government in power?\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm sure I haven't pried into—\"\n  \n \n  \"What about that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out this\nway about ten years back?\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we\n   \n   avoid\n   \n  with the\nGroaci. I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding—\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders\nraking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live down\nthe fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one\noccasion.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?\"\n  \n \n  \"I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed,\ngrilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We try\nnever to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.\"\n  \n \n  \"They never found the cruiser, did they?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly not on Groac.\"\n  \n \n  Retief nodded. \"Thanks, Miss Meuhl,\" he said. \"I'll be back before\nyou close the office.\" Miss Meuhl's face was set in lines of grim\ndisapproval as he closed the door.\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_5]\nThe corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval\nchamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with\ntattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed\nspears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power\nrifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great\nguttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length\nof the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror\npolish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and\npaper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles—and\ncast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n  \n \n  Lesser trolls—beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed—trotted briskly,\nbird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of\nthree strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an\nintricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of\nthe magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried\non a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n  \n \n  \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.\n\"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt—the tallest of the\nfeasters—he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really\nmust hurry along—\"\n  \n \n  \"That one is chief among these rowdies.

And how many units\ncomprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.\nThey mount a variety of weapons.

They're virtually\nidentical, except for the personal touches each individual has given\nhis ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as\nthough these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set\nof toy sailboats!\"\n  \n \n  Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can\nsee that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n  \n \n  \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll\nkindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer\nthe matter to committee.\"\n  \n \n  \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss\nhaving a cosy chat.\"\n  \n \n  There was a pause.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ...

The vibration increased as a second ship lifted, then a third.\n  \n \n  Nitworth whirled on Magnan. \"What's this!

As Second Secretary, he is assigned the mission to investigate the Qornt by Ambassador Nitworth. Retief is assigned to accompany him. However, the Ambassador privately undermines Magnan's authority by giving Retief a separate, contradictory instruction, suggesting a lack of faith in Magnan and establishing an underlying tension in their professional relationship.\n\n##begin_quote##\n\"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said.

Although Magnan was the first person assigned to the job, he is less comfortable out in the field compared to Retief, who ends up making most of the decisions. There is a tension here as they continue their adventure, with Magnan being scared and Retief encouraging him forward, and Retief saving Magnan when he is pinned by the Verpp. Magnan is the one who is explicitly a diplomat, but Retief takes over most conversations—not only does he push the mission forward and insist on following the Verpp to the Qornt, but he eventually declares himself leader of the Qornt. Even when Ambassador Nitworth demands information from Magnan near the end, it is Retief who responds—he wants the Ambassador to know that he is the one calling the shots, even if it has been behind the scenes. It’s clear that Magnan has either not understood this, as if he were being tricked, or he is just not good at giving credit where credit is due, because he refers to the plan as his own recruiting scheme, correcting himself to say it was a group effort, even though it was all Retief’s idea. At the very end of the story, Retief complies to all of Magnan’s requests in an uncharacteristic way—the interpretation is left open, but there is a possibility Retief is hiding something and intends to return as a military leader with the Qornt and perhaps attack the Terrestrials. \n", "\tMagnan is a hesitant man, very aware of himself. His anxiety about the situation at hand is in direct relation to his self-preservation instincts. Retief, on the other hand, is far bolder, willing to sacrifice himself and his safety to explore, solve the issue, or reach a solution. At first, Retief makes fun of Magnan and his hesitancy. Often, Retief has to goad or tease Magnan just to make him come along with him. \n\tAfter Magnan takes down both the Verpps, Retief’s respect for him grows, if only incrementally. Their sarcastic and snarky manner only grows as the story progresses. As they continue on their mission, Magnan continues to question Retief’s ever-present bravery, but this only propels him forward. \n\tOnce Retief challenges Qorn to a duel, Magnan instantly tries to hold him back and questions his train of thought. After hearing Retief’s plan, Magnan backs off and watches his comrade take down the chief. \n\tNow that Retief is their new leader, he and Magnan brainstorm with the Qornt about how to solve the issue at hand. Magnan always leads with the idea of peace, while Retief looks for other solutions. \n\tAlthough they experience some difficulties in the beginning, Magnan and Retief develop a friendly relationship where they are able to question each other, keep the other one safe, and bounce ideas off of each other.\n", "Mangan and Retief begin their adventure on the planet at odds with each other.

Mangan is diplomatic and risk-averse in his interaction while Retief prefers action.\n\nRetief is the cleverer of the two men and understands that although the Verpp and Qornt look imposing, the lower gravity on the planet renders them ineffectual physically. He uses this knowledge to his advantage to defeat Qorn, the leader of the Qornt and bluff the remainder of the population into establishing himself as their leader. Mangan, originally the leader of the expedition falls into line behind Retief's lead.

Ratief tells Magnan to give him an hour to investigate the Qornts and to leave without him if he’s not back in time. Ratief is clearly the braver of the two men. Yet, Magnan is able to show off his own skills and courage when the Qornts show up unexpectedly and jump out from behind a bush. Magnan knocks the aliens down without much thought. \n\nMagnan tries to convince Ratief to go back to their ship, but Ratief refuses and instead says that it’s their job to go get the Qornts’ attention. Although the two Qornts agree to bring them to their leader, Magnan is concerned that the Qornts are secretly plotting an attack against the diplomats. His doubts about their kindness have merit. The two Qornt escorts end up pulling out weapons and threatening the men. This time, it’s Ratief who uses caution and tells Magnan not to scare the Qornts because they may get nervous and shoot. \n\nRatief takes charge of the mission and leaves Magnan’s opinions about the situation out when he tells the Qorn that the two earthmen have come with an ultimatum.

The tall head-dress\nof scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of\npink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n  \n \n  Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n  \n \n  Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n  \n \n  \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match\nbetween you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,\nbut he's got timbre.\"\n  \n \n  \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or\nSmorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?\nA compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the\ntable. \"The answer is\n   \n   no\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that\none.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;\nyou'd best chain him, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, your Excellency—\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n  \n \n  \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered—\"\n  \n \n  \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I\ndon't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!\nI want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the\ntable. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_2]\nThe Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't\ntry conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive\nof our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the\nConfidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a\ncouple of volunteers with plastic beaks—\"\n  \n \n  \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be\nworked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will\nbe a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,\nwell rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any\nrecommendation?\"\n  \n \n  The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a\nstiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n  \n \n  \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,\ndignified, aggressive withdrawal—as soon as possible.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military\nAttache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal—say, until tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of\naction is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population\nof over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the\nPolitical Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk\nby oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.\nHarried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan\neased toward the door.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n  \n \n  \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It\nwas a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to\nlet us know how it works out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of\nchores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field\nexperience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these\nQornt personally.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n  \n \n  \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my\nhead and do something rash if I go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.\nNo dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the\ntransport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n  \n \n  Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves—in any\ndirection.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope\nof towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among\nflamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of\nwhite beach with the blue sea beyond.\n  \n \n  \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we\ncouldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why\ndon't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can\nobserve.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to\nthink of sightseeing.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're\nquestioning Corps policy!\"\n  \n \n  \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it\nmight be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm\nnot back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n  \n \n  \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's directly down-slope—\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan\nclutched at his arm.\n  \n \n  There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy\nbranch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,\ngreen-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like\nsteps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set\namong bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed\nas the creature cocked its head, listening.\n  \n \n  Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed\ndirectly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of\na giant trunk.\n  \n \n  \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps\ninto the brush.\n  \n \n  A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,\ndarted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its\nnarrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,\nturned—and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the\nright. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n  \n \n  Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and\nstopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n  \n \n  \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of\nthem.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_7]\nThere was a momentary silence from all sides.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with\nflame-colored plumes.\n  \n \n  Qorn's eyes bulged. He half rose. \"We've been all over this,\" he\nbassooned. He clamped bony fingers on the hilt of a light rapier. \"I\nthought I'd made my point!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, sure, Qorn.\"\n  \n \n  \"You bet.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm convinced.\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rumbled and resumed his seat. \"All for one and one for all, that's\nus.\"\n  \n \n  \"And you're the one, eh, Qorn?\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  Magnan cleared his throat. \"I sense that some of you gentlemen are not\nconvinced of the wisdom of this move,\" he piped, looking along the\ntable at the silks, jewels, beaks, feather-decked crests and staring\neyes.\n  \n \n  \"Silence!\" Qorn hooted. \"No use your talking to my loyal lieutenants\nanyway,\" he added. \"They do whatever I convince them they ought to do.\"\n  \n \n  \"But I'm sure that on more mature consideration—\"\n  \n \n  \"I can lick any Qornt in the house.\" Qorn said. \"That's why I'm Qorn.\"\nHe belched again.\n  \n \n  A servant came up staggering under a weight of chain, dropped it with a\ncrash at Magnan's feet. Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped\nthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n  \n \n  \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.\nFour loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around\nthem. The servant cinched them up tight, squeezed a lock through the\nends and closed it.\n  \n \n  \"Now,\" Qorn said, lolling back in his chair, glass in hand. \"There's a\nbit of sport to be had here, lads. What shall we do with them?\"\n  \n \n  \"Let them go,\" the blue and flame Qornt said glumly.\n  \n \n  \"You can do better than that,\" Qorn hooted. \"Now here's a suggestion:\nwe carve them up a little—lop off the external labiae and pinnae,\nsay—and ship them back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Good lord! Retief, he's talking about cutting off our ears and sending\nus home mutilated! What a barbaric proposal!\"\n  \n \n  \"It wouldn't be the first time a Terrestrial diplomat got a trimming,\"\nRetief commented.\n  \n \n  \"It should have the effect of stimulating the Terries to put up a\nreasonable scrap,\" Qorn said judiciously. \"I have a feeling that\nthey're thinking of giving up without a struggle.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, I doubt that,\" the blue-and-flame Qornt said. \"Why should they?\"\n  \n \n  Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and another at Magnan. \"Take these two,\"\nhe hooted. \"I'll wager they came here to negotiate a surrender!\"\n  \n \n  \"Well,\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Hold it, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"I'll tell him.\"\n  \n \n  \"What's your proposal?\" Qorn whistled, taking a gulp from his goblet.\n\"A fifty-fifty split? Monetary reparations? Alternate territory? I can\nassure you, it's useless. We Qornt\n   \n   like\n   \n  to fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid you've gotten the wrong impression, your Excellency,\"\nRetief said blandly. \"We didn't come to negotiate. We came to deliver\nan Ultimatum.\"\n  \n \n  \"What?\" Qorn trumpeted. Behind Retief, Magnan spluttered.\n  \n \n  \"We plan to use this planet for target practice,\" Retief said. \"A new\ntype hell bomb we've worked out. Have all your people off of it in\nseventy-two hours, or suffer the consequences.\"\n  \n \n \n  IV\n  \n \n  \"You have the gall,\" Qorn stormed, \"to stand here in the center of\nQornt Hall—uninvited, at that—and in chains—\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, these,\" Retief said. He tensed his arms. The soft aluminum links\nstretched and broke. He shook the light metal free. \"We diplomats like\nto go along with colorful local customs, but I wouldn't want to mislead\nyou. Now, as to the evacuation of Roolit I—\"\n  \n \n \n \n  Zubb screeched, waved the guns. The Qornt were jabbering.\n  \n \n  \"I told you they were brutes,\" Zubb shrilled.\n  \n \n  Qorn slammed his fist down on the table. \"I don't care what they are!\"\nhe honked. \"Evacuate, hell! I can field eighty-five combat-ready ships!\"\n  \n \n  \"And we can englobe every one of them with a thousand Peace Enforcers\nwith a hundred megatons/second firepower each.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief.\" Magnan tugged at his sleeve. \"Don't forget their superdrive.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's all right. They don't have one.\"\n  \n \n  \"But—\"\n  \n \n  \"We'll take you on!\" Qorn French-horned. \"We're the Qorn! We glory in\nbattle! We live in fame or go down in—\"\n  \n \n  \"Hogwash,\" the flame-and-blue Qorn cut in. \"If it wasn't for you, Qorn,\nwe could sit around and feast and brag and enjoy life without having to\nprove anything.\"\n  \n \n  \"Qorn, you seem to be the fire-brand here,\" Retief said. \"I think the\nrest of the boys would listen to reason—\"\n  \n \n  \"Over my dead body!\"\n  \n \n  \"My idea exactly,\" Retief said. \"You claim you can lick any man in\nthe house. Unwind yourself from your ribbons and step out here on the\nfloor, and we'll see how good you are at backing up your conversation.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_8]\nMagnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And\ndid you notice the size of those hands?\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that phenomenal reach—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,\nI'll get a crack at him.\"\n  \n \n  Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n  \n \n  \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n  \n \n  Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens—both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt—formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\n  \n \n  Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg—and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\n  \n \n  Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\n  \n \n  Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n  \n \n  \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your\nweapons, Zubb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   may\n   \n  lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\n  \n \n  Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n  \n \n  \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n  \n \n  The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications—\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we must select a leader!\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_5]\nThe corridor debouched through a high double door into a vast oval\nchamber, high-domed, gloomy, paneled in dark wood and hung with\ntattered banners, scarred halberds, pikes, rusted longswords, crossed\nspears over patinaed hauberks, pitted radiation armor, corroded power\nrifles, the immense mummified heads of horned and fanged animals. Great\nguttering torches in wall brackets and in stands along the length\nof the long table shed a smoky light that reflected from the mirror\npolish of the red granite floor, gleamed on polished silver bowls and\npaper-thin glass, shone jewel-red and gold through dark bottles—and\ncast long flickering shadows behind the fifteen trolls at the board.\n  \n \n  Lesser trolls—beaked, bush-haired, great-eyed—trotted briskly,\nbird-kneed, bearing steaming platters, stood in groups of\nthree strumming slender bottle-shaped lutes, or pranced an\nintricate-patterned dance, unnoticed in the shrill uproar as each of\nthe magnificently draped, belted, feathered and jeweled Qornt carried\non a shouted conversation with an equally noisy fellow.\n  \n \n  \"A most interesting display of barbaric splendor,\" Magnan breathed.\n\"Now we'd better be getting back.\"\n  \n \n  \"Ah, a moment,\" Zubb said. \"Observe the Qornt—the tallest of the\nfeasters—he with the head-dress of crimson, purple, silver and pink.\"\n  \n \n  \"Twelve feet if he's an inch,\" Magnan estimated. \"And now we really\nmust hurry along—\"\n  \n \n  \"That one is chief among these rowdies. I'm sure you'll want a word\nwith him. He controls not only the Tarroonian vessels but those from\nthe other Centers as well.\"\n  \n \n  \"What kind of vessels? Warships?\"\n  \n \n  \"Certainly. What other kind would the Qornt bother with?\"\n  \n \n  \"I don't suppose,\" Magnan said casually, \"that you'd know the type,\ntonnage, armament and manning of these vessels? And how many units\ncomprise the fleet? And where they're based at present?\"\n  \n \n  \"They're fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts.\nThey mount a variety of weapons. The Qornt are fond of that sort of\nthing. Each of the Qornt has his own, of course. They're virtually\nidentical, except for the personal touches each individual has given\nhis ship.\"\n  \n \n  \"Great heavens, Retief!\" Magnan exclaimed in a whisper. \"It sounds as\nthough these brutes employ a battle armada as simpler souls might a set\nof toy sailboats!\"\n  \n \n  Retief stepped past Magnan and Zubb to study the feasting hall. \"I can\nsee that their votes would carry all the necessary weight.\"\n  \n \n  \"And now an interview with the Qorn himself,\" Zubb shrilled. \"If you'll\nkindly step along, gentlemen....\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary,\" Magnan said hastily, \"I've decided to refer\nthe matter to committee.\"\n  \n \n  \"After having come so far,\" Zubb said, \"it would be a pity to miss\nhaving a cosy chat.\"\n  \n \n  There was a pause.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Zubb has just presented a most\ncompelling argument....\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_4]\nThe beak twitched. \"Smorbrod? I know of no place called Smorbrod.\"\n  \n \n  \"The outer planet of this system.\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes. We call it Guzzum. I had heard that some sort of creatures\nhad established a settlement there, but I confess I pay little note to\nsuch matters.\"\n  \n \n  \"We're wasting time, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"We must truss these chaps\nup, hurry back to the boat and make our escape. You heard what they\nsaid.\"\n  \n \n  \"Are there any Qornt down there at the harbor, where the boats are?\"\nRetief asked.\n  \n \n  \"At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. Planning some adventure.\"\n  \n \n  \"That would be the invasion of Smorbrod,\" Magnan said. \"And unless we\nhurry, Retief, we're likely to be caught there with the last of the\nevacuees!\"\n  \n \n  \"How many Qornt would you say there are at Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, a very large number. Perhaps fifteen or twenty.\"\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty what?\" Magnan looked perplexed.\n  \n \n  \"Fifteen or twenty Qornt.\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean that there are only fifteen or twenty individual Qornt in\nall?\"\n  \n \n  Another whistle. \"Not at all. I was referring to the local Qornt only.\nThere are more at the other Centers, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"And the Qornt are responsible for the ultimatum—unilaterally?\"\n  \n \n  \"I suppose so; it sounds like them. A truculent group, you know. And\ninterplanetary relations\n   \n   are\n   \n  rather a hobby of theirs.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat up slowly, rubbing his head. He spoke\nto his companion in a shrill alien clatter of consonants.\n  \n \n  \"What did he say?\"\n  \n \n  \"Poor Zubb. He blames me for his bruises, since it was my idea to\ngather you as specimens.\"\n  \n \n  \"You should have known better than to tackle that fierce-looking\ncreature,\" Zubb said, pointing his beak at Magnan.\n  \n \n  \"How does it happen that you speak Terrestrial?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, one picks up all sorts of dialects.\"\n  \n \n  \"It's quite charming, really,\" Magnan said. \"Such a quaint, archaic\naccent.\"\n  \n \n  \"Suppose we went down to Tarroon,\" Retief asked. \"What kind of\nreception would we get?\"\n  \n \n  \"That depends. I wouldn't recommend interfering with the Gwil or the\nRheuk; it's their nest-mending time, you know. The Boog will be busy\nmating—such a tedious business—and of course the Qornt are tied up\nwith their ceremonial feasting. I'm afraid no one will take any notice\nof you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Do you mean to say,\" Magnan demanded, \"that these ferocious Qornt, who\nhave issued an ultimatum to the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne—who\nopenly avow their occupied world—would ignore Terrestrials in their\nmidst?\"\n  \n \n  \"If at all possible.\"\n  \n \n  Retief got to his feet.\n  \n \n  \"I think our course is clear, Mr. Magnan. It's up to us to go down and\nattract a little attention.\"\n  \n \n \n  III\n  \n \n  \"I'm not at all sure we're going about this in the right way,\" Magnan\npuffed, trotting at Retief's side. \"These fellows Zubb and Slun—Oh,\nthey seem affable enough, but how can we be sure we're not being led\ninto a trap?\"\n  \n \n  \"We can't.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stopped short. \"Let's go back.\"\n  \n \n  \"All right,\" Retief said. \"Of course there may be an ambush—\"\n  \n \n  Magnan moved off. \"Let's keep going.\"\n  \n \n  The party emerged from the undergrowth at the edge of a great\nbrush-grown mound. Slun took the lead, rounded the flank of the\nhillock, halted at a rectangular opening cut into the slope.\n  \n \n  \"You can find your way easily enough from here,\" he said. \"You'll\nexcuse us, I hope—\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense, Slun!\" Zubb pushed forward. \"I'll escort our guests to Qornt\nHall.\" He twittered briefly to his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered back.\n  \n \n  \"I don't like it, Retief,\" Magnan whispered. \"Those fellows are\nplotting mischief.\"\n  \n \n  \"Threaten them with violence, Mr Magnan. They're scared of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"That's true. And the drubbing they received was well-deserved. I'm a\npatient man, but there are occasions—\"\n  \n \n  \"Come along, please,\" Zubb called. \"Another ten minutes' walk—\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, we have no interest in investigating this barrow,\" Magnan\nannounced. \"We wish you to take us direct to Tarroon to interview your\nmilitary leaders regarding the ultimatum!\"\n  \n \n  \"Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall lies here inside the village.\"\n  \n \n  \"This is Tarroon?\"\n  \n \n  \"A modest civic center, sir, but there are those who love it.\"\n  \n \n  \"No wonder we didn't observe their works from the air,\" Magnan\nmuttered. \"Camouflaged.\" He moved hesitantly through the opening.\n  \n \n  The party moved along a wide, deserted tunnel which sloped down\nsteeply, then leveled off and branched. Zubb took the center branch,\nducking slightly under the nine-foot ceiling lit at intervals with what\nappeared to be primitive incandescent panels.\n  \n \n  \"Few signs of an advanced technology here,\" Magnan whispered. \"These\ncreatures must devote all their talents to warlike enterprise.\"\n  \n \n  Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant susurration was audible, a sustained\nhigh-pitched screeching. \"Softly, now. We approach Qornt Hall. They\ncan be an irascible lot when disturbed at their feasting.\"\n  \n \n  \"When will the feast be over?\" Magnan called hoarsely.\n  \n \n  \"In another few weeks, I should imagine, if, as you say, they've\nscheduled an invasion for next month.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here, Zubb.\" Magnan shook a finger at the tall alien. \"How is it\nthat these Qornt are allowed to embark on piratical ventures of this\nsort without reference to the wishes of the majority?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, the majority of the Qornt favor the move, I imagine.\"\n  \n \n  \"These few hotheads are permitted to embroil the planet in war?\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, they don't embroil the planet in war. They merely—\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, this is fantastic! I've heard of iron-fisted military cliques\nbefore, but this is madness!\"\n  \n \n  \"Come softly, now.\" Zubb beckoned, moving toward a bend in the\nyellow-lit corridor. Retief and Magnan moved forward.\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_11]\nOutside in the corridor, Magnan came up to Retief, who stood talking to\na tall man in a pilot's coverall.\n  \n \n  \"I'll be tied up, sending through full details on my—our—your\nrecruiting theme, Retief,\" Magnan said. \"Suppose you run into the city\nto assist the new Verpp Consul in settling in.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll do that, Mr. Magnan. Anything else?\"\n  \n \n  Magnan raised his eyebrows. \"You're remarkably compliant today, Retief.\nI'll arrange transportation.\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't bother, Mr. Magnan. Cy here will run me over.

After his initial glance to confirm\nhis identification of Crandon, Don could not bear to look at him.\n  \n \n  Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. \"You're partly right\nabout us, of course. I hate to think how many laws this organization\nhas broken. Don't condemn us yet, though. You'll be a member yourself\nbefore the day is over.\"\n  \n \n  Don was shocked by such confidence in his corruptibility.\n  \n \n  \"What do you use?\" he asked bitterly. \"Drugs? Hypnosis?\"\n  \n \n  Crandon sighed. \"I forgot how little you know, Don. I have a long\nstory to tell you. You'll find it hard to believe at first. But try to\ntrust me. Try to believe me, as you once did. When I say that much of\nwhat POSAT does is illegal, I do not mean immoral. We're probably the\nmost moral organization in the world. Get over the idea that you have\nstumbled into a den of thieves.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon paused as though searching for words with which to continue.\n  \n \n  \"Did you notice the paintings in the waiting room as you entered?\"\n  \n \n  Don nodded, too bewildered to speak.\n  \n \n  \"They were donated by the founder of our Organization. They were part\nof his personal collection—which, incidentally, he bought from the\nartists themselves. He also designed the atomic reactor we use for\npower here in the laboratory.\"\n  \n \n  \"Then the pictures are modern,\" said Don, aware that his mouth was\nhanging open foolishly. \"I thought one was a Titian—\"\n  \n \n  \"It is,\" said Crandon. \"We have several original Titians, although I\nreally don't know too much about them.\"\n  \n \n  \"But how could a man alive\n   \n   today\n   \n  buy paintings from an artist of the\nRenaissance?\"\n  \n \n  \"He is not alive today.

This particular one has been in use for only twenty years,\nhowever.\"\n  \n \n  Don's confusion was complete. Crandon looked at him kindly. \"Let's\nstart at the beginning,\" he said, and Don was back again in the\nclassroom with the deep voice of Professor Crandon unfolding the\npages of knowledge in clear and logical manner. \"Four hundred years\nago, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, a man lived who was a\nsuper-genius. His was the kind of incredible mentality that appears not\nin every generation, or even every century, but once in thousands of\nyears.\n  \n \n  \"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic alphabet was\none like him. That man lived seven thousand years ago in Mesopotamia,\nand his discovery was so original, so far from the natural course\nof man's thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand\nyears has that device been rediscovered. It still exists only in the\ncivilizations to which it has been passed on directly.\n  \n \n  \"The super-genius who was our founder was not a semanticist. He was\na physical scientist and mathematician. Starting with the meager\nheritage that existed in these fields in his time, he began tackling\nphysical puzzles one by one. Sitting in his study, using as his\nprincipal tool his own great mind, he invented calculus, developed the\nquantum theory of light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what\nwe call Maxwell's equations—although, of course, he antedated Maxwell\nby centuries—developed the special and general theories of relativity,\nthe tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end of his life, he\nmathematically derived the packing fraction that describes the binding\nenergy of nuclei—\"\n  \n \n  \"But it can't be done,\" Don objected. \"It's an observed phenomenon. It\nhasn't been derived.\" Every conservative instinct that he possessed\ncried out against this impossible fantasy. And yet—there sat the\nreactor, sheathed in its strange shield. Crandon watched the direction\nof Don's glance.\n  \n \n  \"Yes, the reactor,\" said Crandon. \"He built one like it. It confirmed\nhis theories. His calculations showed him something else too. He saw\nthe destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself could\nnot have built an atomic bomb; he didn't have the facilities. But his\nknowledge would have enabled other men to do so. He looked about\nhim. He saw a political setup of warring principalities, rival states,\nintrigue, and squabbles over political power. Giving the men of his\ntime atomic energy would have been like handing a baby a firecracker\nwith a lighted fuse.\n  \n \n  \"What should he have done? Let his secrets die with him? He\ndidn't think so. No one else in his age could have\n   \n   derived\n   \n  the\nknowledge that he did. But it was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo.\nMichelangelo. There were men capable of\n   \n   learning\n   \n  his science, even as\nmen can learn it today. He gathered some of them together and founded\nthis society. It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries\nand at the same time it maintained the greatest secrecy about them. He\nurged that the secrets be kept until the time when men could use them\nsafely. The other purpose was to make that time come about as soon as\npossible.\"\n  \n \n  Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. \"How can I make you see that\nit is the truth? Think of the eons that man or manlike creatures have\nwalked the Earth. Think what a small fraction of that time is four\nhundred years. Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a\nlittle early, by this displacement in time that is so tiny after all?\"\n  \n \n  \"But by one man,\" Don argued.\n  \n \n  Crandon shrugged. \"Compared with him, Don, you and I are stupid men.\nSo are the scientists who slowly plodded down the same road he had\ncome, stumbling first on one truth and then the succeeding one. We know\nthat inventions and discoveries do not occur at random. Each is based\non the one that preceded it. We are all aware of the phenomenon of\nsimultaneous invention. The path to truth is a straight one. It is only\nour own stupidity that makes it seem slow and tortuous.\n  \n \n  \"He merely followed the straight path,\" Crandon finished simply.\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_9]\n\"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine\nglass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like\nto fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't mind a little fighting—within reason.

Their military mindset is characterized by a truculent and aggressive nature, driven by a love for battle and glory rather than strategic necessity. Their primary military tools are powerful, personalized warships.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  The initial conviction of a Qornt tactical advantage stems from their sudden and completely undetected arrival in Terrestrial territory. The Navigational Monitor Service, which should have detected any approaching fleet, registered nothing. This leads Ambassador Nitworth to conclude the Qornt must have a technology far beyond their own.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    \"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial controlled soil—and without so much as a flicker from the instruments of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n    ##end_quote##\n\n2.  The Ambassador explicitly states that this capability makes the Qornt fleet \"indetectible,\" a technological advantage that makes direct military confrontation impossible until the Terrestrials can develop a similar technology.

Information gathered on the Qornt planet reveals that their military is formidable. Each individual Qornt possesses their own personal, heavily armed warship. This suggests a large, decentralized, yet powerful armada. The Verpp describes these vessels as \"fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts\" with a \"variety of weapons.\"\n\n4.  The Qornt's military mindset is not strategic but instinctual and aggressive. They are described as a \"truculent group\" who enjoy conflict. Their leader, Qorn, explicitly rejects peace, stating he desires battle for its own sake, seeking \"action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" This makes them unpredictable and difficult to negotiate with, as their motivations are not based on typical diplomatic or political goals.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    \"Want peace, do you?

Their military tools consist of a large fleet of powerful, \"fully automated twenty-thousand-ton all-purpose dreadnaughts,\" with each of the fifteen to twenty Qornt at the Tarroon center possessing his own personal warship."}], "metadata": {"id": "528", "include_oracle": true, "num_quotes": 3, "reference_answers": ["Because they Qornt have been underground for two centuries while they molted from the Verpp stage of their life cycle, they have gone undetected by the Terrestrials in this time. This led the Terrestrials to believe that the Qornt possessed superior technology of some kind, as they seemed to have reappeared out of nowhere. However, this is not the case, and it was merely that the group remained dormant for a long time. There are rumors of stealth technology and superior ships, including a superdrive, but not much firsthand information until Magnan and Retief make it to the surface of Roolit I, the planet that the Qornt are currently occupying. It is true that the Verpp and Qornt are physically larger than the Terrestrials, but the systems of gravity on the different planets means that the smaller Terrestrials are actually stronger and have a kind of advantage on Roolit I. The Verpp tell Magnan that the Qornt have huge, powerful warships that have a variety of weapon types. Not only this, but each Qornt has his own ship, which means that there is a large fleet of these. It comes to Magnan as a surprise, then, that the Qornt are not worried about diplomatic negotiation, but instead just seem to have an impulse that drives them to be in battle. ", "\tWhen the Qornt reappears after a 200-year hiatus, Ambassador Nitworth and his men are terrified because their radars are unable to find them. Because of this, and the Qornt’s leader’s claim about their unrivaled weaponry, the men are sure of their demise. They gather their forces to come up with five different relocation plans and decide to execute the best one in 24 short hours. \n\tWith a population of 15 million Terrestrials, relocation is a mighty feat. By choosing relocation, it’s clear that Ambassador Nitworth and his men have no faith in their fleet’s ability against the Qornt’s. \n\tLater on, when Retief and Magnan are with the Zubb and the Qornt, we discover that each Qornt has his own dreadnought. Zubb talks them up as well, explaining in detail about these fully automated warships. He also mentions their super drive and their unstoppable army. However, Retief is smart enough to figure out that since they’ve been underground for 200 years, they wouldn’t have access to all of this new technology. The Qornt are still a warring species, though, advanced technology or not. \n\tSince the leader and his men were not in line, their power fell dramatically. Retief was able to become their new leader with relative ease. He also appeases their warlike ways by assigning them to the Peace Enforcement Corps.\n", "The men are convinced of Qornt superiority due to the fact that they appeared on the planet undetected by their instruments. Later, Mangan and Retief learn that the Qornt command a massive armada of warships that would be a imposing threat to the Terrestrials.\n\nThe military mindset of the Terrestrials is similarly aggressive as the Qornt. They are intent on countering the perceived threat but seeing that they are facing a technologically superior foe, they seek to surrender and save their population.", "The humans’ tools are unable to detect the Qornts’ invasion at the beginning of the story, so they assume that they have far more advanced equipment. It is obvious that they have never before seen an arrival go completely undetected by their tools. At the end of the story, however, the truth that the Qornts were hibernating underground for 200 years comes to light. Therefore, the earth men did not “miss” their invasion, they just didn’t know that there were dozens of them buried underground. \n\nThe Qornts are self-proclaimed lovers of war. The original Qorn says that he has no desire for peace between his people and the earthlings because he much prefers adventure and action, regardless of the potential loss of life. Although some of his subordinates do not agree with his decision to battle the earth men, they do acknowledge that war is an essential part of the Qornts’ society. \n\nThe Qornts are not always Qornts. Before they are Qornts, they are Verpp, and before that they are Rheuk, and before that, Boog, etc. No one survives the Qornt stage because the Qornt love military life. \n"]}}

I sent the boys off to handle it.\"\n  \n \n  \"Call them back at once!\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm afraid that won't be possible. They're under orders to maintain\ntotal communications silence until completion of the mission.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth drummed his fingers on the desk top. Slowly, a thoughtful\nexpression dawned. He nodded.\n  \n \n  \"This may work out,\" he said. \"I\n   \n   should\n   \n  call them back, but since\nthe fleet is out of contact, I'm unable to do so, correct? Thus I can\nhardly be held responsible for any over-enthusiasm in chastising the\nGroaci.\"\n  \n \n  He closed one eye in a broad wink at Magnan. \"Very well, gentlemen,\nI'll overlook the irregularity this time. Magnan, see to it the\nSmorbrodian public are notified they can remain where they are. And\nby the way, did you by any chance discover the technique of the\nindetectable drive the Qornt use?\"\n  \n \n  \"No, sir. That is, yes, sir.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well? Well?\"\n  \n \n  \"There isn't any. The Qornt were there all the while. Underground.\"\n  \n \n  \"Underground? Doing what?\"\n  \n \n  \"Hibernating—for two hundred years at a stretch.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_8]\nMagnan hovered at Retief's side. \"Twelve feet tall,\" he moaned. \"And\ndid you notice the size of those hands?\"\n  \n \n  Retief watched as Qorn's aides helped him out of his formal trappings.\n\"I wouldn't worry too much, Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee world. I\ndoubt if old Qorn would weigh up at more than two-fifty standard pounds\nhere.\"\n  \n \n  \"But that phenomenal reach—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll peck away at him at knee level. When he bends over to swat me,\nI'll get a crack at him.\"\n  \n \n  Across the cleared floor, Qorn shook off his helpers with a snort.\n  \n \n  \"Enough! Let me at the upstart!\"\n  \n \n  Retief moved out to meet him, watching the upraised backward-jointed\narms. Qorn stalked forward, long lean legs bent, long horny feet\nclacking against the polished floor. The other aliens—both servitors\nand bejeweled Qornt—formed a wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on the\ncombatants.\n  \n \n  Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm flashing down in a vicious cut at\nRetief, who leaned aside, caught one lean shank below the knee. Qorn\nbent to haul Retief from his leg—and staggered back as a haymaker took\nhim just below the beak. A screech went up from the crowd as Retief\nleaped clear.\n  \n \n  Qorn hissed and charged. Retief whirled aside, then struck the alien's\noff-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn leaned, arms windmilling, crashed to\nthe floor. Retief whirled, dived for the left arm, whipped it behind\nthe narrow back, seized Qorn's neck in a stranglehold and threw his\nweight backward. Qorn fell on his back, his legs squatted out at an\nawkward angle. He squawked and beat his free arm on the floor, reaching\nin vain for Retief.\n  \n \n  Zubb stepped forward, pistols ready. Magnan stepped before him.\n  \n \n  \"Need I remind you, sir,\" he said icily, \"that this is an official\ndiplomatic function? I can brook no interference from disinterested\nparties.\"\n  \n \n  Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out a hand. \"I must ask you to hand me your\nweapons, Zubb.\"\n  \n \n  \"Look here,\" Zubb began.\n  \n \n  \"I\n   \n   may\n   \n  lose my temper,\" Magnan hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, passed\nthem to Magnan. He thrust them into his belt with a sour smile, turned\nback to watch the encounter.\n  \n \n  Retief had thrown a turn of violet silk around Qorn's left wrist, bound\nit to the alien's neck. Another wisp of stuff floated from Qorn's\nshoulder. Retief, still holding Qorn in an awkward sprawl, wrapped\nit around one outflung leg, trussed ankle and thigh together. Qorn\nflopped, hooting. At each movement, the constricting loop around his\nneck, jerked his head back, the green crest tossing wildly.\n  \n \n  \"If I were you, I'd relax,\" Retief said, rising and releasing his grip.\nQorn got a leg under him; Retief kicked it. Qorn's chin hit the floor\nwith a hollow clack. He wilted, an ungainly tangle of over-long limbs\nand gay silks.\n  \n \n  Retief turned to the watching crowd. \"Next?\" he called.\n  \n \n  The blue and flame Qornt stepped forward. \"Maybe this would be a good\ntime to elect a new leader,\" he said. \"Now, my qualifications—\"\n  \n \n  \"Sit down,\" Retief said loudly. He stepped to the head of the table,\nseated himself in Qorn's vacated chair. \"A couple of you finish\ntrussing Qorn up for me.\"\n  \n \n  \"But we must select a leader!\"\n  \n \n  \"That won't be necessary, boys. I'm your new leader.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_2]\nThe Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"In that case, we can't\ntry conclusions with these fellows until we have an indetectible drive\nof our own. I recommend a crash project. In the meantime—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'll have my boys start in to crack this thing,\" the Chief of the\nConfidential Terrestrial Source Section spoke up. \"I'll fit out a\ncouple of volunteers with plastic beaks—\"\n  \n \n  \"No cloak and dagger work, gentlemen! Long range policy will be\nworked out by Deep-Think teams back at the Department. Our role will\nbe a holding action. Now I want suggestions for a comprehensive,\nwell rounded and decisive course for meeting this threat. Any\nrecommendation?\"\n  \n \n  The Political Officer placed his fingertips together. \"What about a\nstiff Note demanding an extra week's time?\"\n  \n \n  \"No! No begging,\" the Economic Officer objected. \"I'd say a calm,\ndignified, aggressive withdrawal—as soon as possible.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't want to give them the idea we spook easily,\" the Military\nAttache said. \"Let's delay the withdrawal—say, until tomorrow.\"\n  \n \n  \"Early tomorrow,\" Magnan said. \"Or maybe later today.\"\n  \n \n  \"Well, I see you're of a mind with me,\" Nitworth nodded. \"Our plan of\naction is clear, but it remains to be implemented. We have a population\nof over fifteen million individuals to relocate.\" He eyed the\nPolitical Officer. \"I want five proposals for resettlement on my desk\nby oh-eight-hundred hours tomorrow.\" Nitworth rapped out instructions.\nHarried-looking staff members arose and hurried from the room. Magnan\neased toward the door.\n  \n \n  \"Where are you going, Magnan?\" Nitworth snapped.\n  \n \n  \"Since you're so busy, I thought I'd just slip back down to Com Inq. It\nwas a most interesting orientation lecture, Mr. Ambassador. Be sure to\nlet us know how it works out.\"\n  \n \n  \"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of\nchores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field\nexperience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these\nQornt personally.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n  \n \n  \"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n  \n \n  \"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my\nhead and do something rash if I go.\"\n  \n \n  \"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses. Take Retief along.\nNo dawdling, now! I want you on the way in two hours. Notify the\ntransport pool at once. Now get going!\"\n  \n \n  Magnan nodded unhappily and went into the hall.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, Retief,\" Nitworth said. Retief turned.\n  \n \n  \"Try to restrain Mr. Magnan from any impulsive moves—in any\ndirection.\"\n  \n \n \n  II\n  \n \n  Retief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope\nof towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among\nflamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of\nwhite beach with the blue sea beyond.\n  \n \n  \"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we\ncouldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report—\"\n  \n \n  \"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why\ndon't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can\nobserve.\"\n  \n \n  \"Retief, we're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to\nthink of sightseeing.\"\n  \n \n  \"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n  \n \n  \"See here, Retief! One might almost receive the impression that you're\nquestioning Corps policy!\"\n  \n \n  \"One might, at that. The Qornt have made their play, but I think it\nmight be valuable to take a look at their cards before we fold. If I'm\nnot back at the boat in an hour, lift without me.\"\n  \n \n  \"You expect me to make my way back alone?\"\n  \n \n  \"It's directly down-slope—\" Retief broke off, listening. Magnan\nclutched at his arm.\n  \n \n  There was a sound of crackling foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy\nbranch swung aside. An eight-foot biped stepped into view, long, thin,\ngreen-clad legs with back-bending knees moving in quick, bird-like\nsteps. A pair of immense black-lensed goggles covered staring eyes set\namong bushy green hair above a great bone-white beak. The crest bobbed\nas the creature cocked its head, listening.\n  \n \n  Magnan gulped audibly. The Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed\ndirectly at the spot where the Terrestrials stood in the deep shade of\na giant trunk.\n  \n \n  \"I'll go for help,\" Magnan squeaked. He whirled and took three leaps\ninto the brush.\n  \n \n  A second great green-clad figure rose up to block his way. He spun,\ndarted to the left. The first Qornt pounced, grappled Magnan to its\nnarrow chest. Magnan yelled, threshing and kicking, broke free,\nturned—and collided with the eight-foot alien, coming in fast from the\nright. All three went down in a tangle of limbs.\n  \n \n  Retief jumped forward, hauled Magnan free, thrust him aside and\nstopped, right fist cocked. The two Qornt lay groaning feebly.\n  \n \n  \"Nice piece of work, Mr. Magnan,\" Retief said. \"You nailed both of\nthem.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_9]\n\"As I see it,\" Retief said, dribbling cigar ashes into an empty wine\nglass, \"you Qornt like to be warriors, but you don't particularly like\nto fight.\"\n  \n \n  \"We don't mind a little fighting—within reason. And, of course, as\nQornt, we're expected to die in battle. But what I say is, why rush\nthings?\"\n  \n \n  \"I have a suggestion,\" Magnan said. \"Why not turn the reins of\ngovernment over to the Verpp? They seem a level-headed group.\"\n  \n \n  \"What good would that do? Qornt are Qornt. It seems there's always one\namong us who's a slave to instinct—and, naturally, we have to follow\nhim.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"Because that's the way it's done.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why not do it another way?\" Magnan offered. \"Now, I'd like to suggest\ncommunity singing—\"\n  \n \n  \"If we gave up fighting, we might live too long. Then what would\nhappen?\"\n  \n \n  \"Live too long?\" Magnan looked puzzled.\n  \n \n  \"When estivating time comes there'd be no burrows for us. Anyway, with\nthe new Qornt stepping on our heels—\"\n  \n \n  \"I've lost the thread,\" Magnan said. \"Who are the new Qornt?\"\n  \n \n  \"After estivating, the Verpp moult, and then they're Qornt, of course.\nThe Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, the Rheuk metamorphosize\ninto Verpp—\"\n  \n \n  \"You mean Slun and Zubb—the mild-natured naturalists—will become\nwarmongers like Qorn?\"\n  \n \n  \"Very likely. 'The milder the Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,' as the old\nsaying goes.\"\n  \n \n  \"What do Qornt turn into?\" Retief asked.\n  \n \n  \"Hmmmm. That's a good question. So far, none have survived Qornthood.\"\n  \n \n  \"Have you thought of forsaking your warlike ways?\" Magnan asked. \"What\nabout taking up sheepherding and regular church attendance?\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't mistake me. We Qornt like a military life. It's great sport to\nsit around roaring fires and drink and tell lies and then go dashing\noff to enjoy a brisk affray and some leisurely looting afterward. But\nwe prefer a nice numerical advantage. Not this business of tackling you\nTerrestrials over on Guzzum—that was a mad notion. We had no idea what\nyour strength was.\"\n  \n \n  \"But now that's all off, of course,\" Magnan chirped. \"Now that we've\nhad diplomatic relations and all—\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts in thirty days. After all, we're\nQornt; we have to satisfy our drive to action.\"\n  \n \n  \"But Mr. Retief is your leader now. He won't let you!\"\n  \n \n  \"Only a dead Qornt stays home when Attack day comes. And even if\nhe orders us all to cut our own throats, there are still the other\nCenters—all with their own leaders. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is\ndefinitely on.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why don't you go invade somebody else?\" Magnan suggested. \"I could\nname some very attractive prospects—outside my sector, of course.\"\n  \n \n  \"Hold everything,\" Retief said. \"I think we've got the basis of a deal\nhere....\"\n  \n \n \n  V\n  \n \n  At the head of a double column of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, Retief\nand Magnan strolled across the ramp toward the bright tower of the CDT\nSector HQ. Ahead, gates opened, and a black Corps limousine emerged,\nflying an Ambassadorial flag under a plain square of white.\n  \n \n  \"Curious,\" Magnan commented. \"I wonder what the significance of the\nwhite ensign might be?\"\n  \n \n  Retief raised a hand. The column halted with a clash of accoutrements\nand a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief looked back along the line. The high\nwhite sun flashed on bright silks, polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes,\nbutts of pistols, the soft gleam of leather.\n  \n \n  \"A brave show indeed,\" Magnan commented approvingly. \"I confess the\nidea has merit.\"\n  \n \n  The limousine pulled up with a squeal of brakes, stood on two fat-tired\nwheels, gyros humming softly. The hatch popped up. A portly diplomat\nstepped out.\n  \n \n  \"Why, Ambassador Nitworth,\" Magnan glowed. \"This is very kind of you.\"\n  \n \n  \"Keep cool, Magnan,\" Nitworth said in a strained voice. \"We'll attempt\nto get you out of this.\"\n  \n \n  He stepped past Magnan's out-stretched hand and looked hesitantly at\nthe ramrod-straight line of Qornt, eighty-five strong—and beyond, at\nthe eighty-five tall Qornt dreadnaughts.\n  \n \n  \"Good afternoon, sir ... ah, Your Excellency,\" Nitworth said, blinking\nup at the leading Qornt. \"You are Commander of the Strike Force, I\nassume?\"\n  \n \n  \"Nope,\" the Qornt said shortly.\n  \n \n  \"I ... ah ... wish to request seventy-two hours in which to evacuate\nHeadquarters,\" Nitworth plowed on.\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Ambassador.\" Retief said. \"This—\"\n  \n \n  \"Don't panic, Retief. I'll attempt to secure your release,\" Nitworth\nhissed over his shoulder. \"Now—\"\n  \n \n  \"You will address our leader with more respect!\" the tall Qornt hooted,\neyeing Nitworth ominously from eleven feet up.\n  \n \n  \"Oh, yes indeed, sir ... your Excellency ... Commander. Now, about the\ninvasion—\"\n  \n \n  \"Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan tugged at Nitworth's sleeve.\n  \n \n  \"In heaven's name, permit me to negotiate in peace!\" Nitworth snapped.\nHe rearranged his features. \"Now your Excellency, we've arranged to\nevacuate Smorbrod, of course, just as you requested—\"\n  \n \n  \"Requested?\" the Qornt honked.\n  \n \n  \"Ah ... demanded, that is. Quite rightly of course. Ordered.\nInstructed. And, of course, we'll be only too pleased to follow any\nother instructions you might have.\"\n  \n \n  \"You don't quite get the big picture, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said.\n\"This isn't—\"\n  \n \n  \"Silence, confound you!\" Nitworth barked. The leading Qornt looked at\nRetief. He nodded. Two bony hands shot out, seized Nitworth and stuffed\na length of bright pink silk into his mouth, then spun him around and\nheld him facing Retief.\n  \n \n  \"If you don't mind my taking this opportunity to brief you, Mr.\nAmbassador,\" Retief said blandly. \"I think I should mention that this\nisn't an invasion fleet. These are the new recruits for the Peace\nEnforcement Corps.\"\n  \n \n  Magnan stepped forward, glanced at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth's\nmouth, hesitated, then cleared his throat. \"We felt,\" he said, \"that\nthe establishment of a Foreign Brigade within the P. E. Corps structure\nwould provide the element of novelty the Department has requested\nin our recruiting, and at the same time would remove the stigma of\nTerrestrial chauvinism from future punitive operations.\"\n  \n \n  Nitworth stared, eyes bulging. He grunted, reaching for the gag, caught\nthe Qornt's eye on him, dropped his hands to his sides.\n  \n \n  \"I suggest we get the troops in out of the hot sun,\" Retief said.\nMagnan edged close. \"What about the gag?\" he whispered.\n  \n \n  \"Let's leave it where it is for a while,\" Retief murmured. \"It may save\nus a few concessions.\"\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_6]\nRetief turned. Zubb stood gripping an ornately decorated power pistol\nin one bony hand, a slim needler in the other. Both were pointed at\nMagnan's chest.\n  \n \n  \"I suspected you had hidden qualities, Zubb,\" Retief commented.\n  \n \n  \"See here, Zubb! We're diplomats!\" Magnan started.\n  \n \n  \"Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may goad him to a frenzy.\"\n  \n \n  \"By no means,\" Zubb whistled. \"I much prefer to observe the frenzy\nof the Qornt when presented with the news that two peaceful Verpp\nhave been assaulted and kidnapped by bullying interlopers. If there's\nanything that annoys the Qornt, it's Qornt-like behavior in others. Now\nstep along, please.\"\n  \n \n  \"Rest assured, this will be reported!\"\n  \n \n  \"I doubt it.\"\n  \n \n  \"You'll face the wrath of Enlightened Galactic Opinion!\"\n  \n \n  \"Oh? How big a navy does Enlightened Galactic Opinion have?\"\n  \n \n  \"Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. He may get nervous and shoot.\" Retief\nstepped into the banquet hall, headed for the resplendent figure at\nthe head of the table. A trio of flute-players broke off in mid-bleat,\nstaring. An inverted pyramid of tumblers blinked as Retief swung past,\nfollowed by Magnan and the tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the table\nfaded.\n  \n \n  Qorn turned as Retief came up, blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb stepped\nforward, gibbered, waving his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed back his\nchair—a low, heavily padded stool—and stared unwinking at Retief,\nmoving his head to bring first one great round eye, then the other, to\nbear. There were small blue veins in the immense fleshy beak. The bushy\nhair, springing out in a giant halo around the grayish, porous-skinned\nface, was wiry, stiff, moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse fuzz\nsurrounding what appeared to be tympanic membranes. The tall head-dress\nof scarlet silk and purple feathers was slightly askew, and a loop of\npink pearls had slipped down above one eye.\n  \n \n  Zubb finished his speech and fell silent, breathing hard.\n  \n \n  Qorn looked Retief over in silence, then belched.\n  \n \n  \"Not bad,\" Retief said admiringly. \"Maybe we could get up a match\nbetween you and Ambassador Sternwheeler. You've got the volume on him,\nbut he's got timbre.\"\n  \n \n  \"So,\" Qorn hooted in a resonant tenor. \"You come from Guzzum, eh? Or\nSmorbrod, as I think you call it. What is it you're after? More time?\nA compromise? Negotiations? Peace?\" He slammed a bony hand against the\ntable. \"The answer is\n   \n   no\n   \n  !\"\n  \n \n  Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an eye, motioned to a servant. \"Chain that\none.\" He indicated Magnan. His eyes went to Retief. \"This one's bigger;\nyou'd best chain him, too.\"\n  \n \n  \"Why, your Excellency—\" Magnan started, stepping forward.\n  \n \n  \"Stay back!\" Qorn hooted. \"Stand over there where I can keep an eye on\nyou.\"\n  \n \n  \"Your Excellency, I'm empowered—\"\n  \n \n  \"Not here, you're not!\" Qorn trumpeted. \"Want peace, do you? Well, I\ndon't want peace! I've had a surfeit of peace these last two centuries!\nI want action! Loot! Adventure! Glory!\" He turned to look down the\ntable. \"How about it, fellows? It's war to the knife, eh?\"\n\n[Chapter: LOST_IN_TRANSLATION_2]\nThe Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The\nwalls were dark-brown, the furnishings—a single great chair, several\nkneeling-benches and a small table near the chair—were light-brown,\nof some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was,\nKorvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color\ncontrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.\n  \n \n  The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly\nbroad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the\ntable near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on\neither side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues,\nsix and a half feet high.\n  \n \n  Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler.\nHe wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\n  \n \n  The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race.\nThe Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex—if\nany—and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\n  \n \n  Korvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I\nam,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\"\n  \n \n  \"Within what limits?\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others\nunder four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it\ndidn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height\nwere at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he\nwent on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and\nusually less than that—approximately nine or ten inches. We call\nthese\n   \n   children\n   \n  ,\" he volunteered helpfully.\n  \n \n  \"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he\nsaid. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he\nsaid apologetically.\n  \n \n  \"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered.\n  \n \n  \"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can\nfor you.\"\n  \n \n  \"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He\npaused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he\nwent on. \"Why?\"\n  \n \n  \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations\nprove that beyond any doubt.\"\n  \n \n  \"True,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you\nhave tests for such matters?\"\n  \n \n  \"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A\nmachine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology.\nIt will be attached to you.\"\n  \n \n  Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two\ntechnicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels,\ndials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and\nstraps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector—and Korvin felt\nhimself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to\nmatch their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a\nhypnopædic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been\nwonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that\nnecessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle.\nThe Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable\naddition to the Comity of Nations.\n  \n \n  Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And\nKorvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\n  \n \n  He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed\nhim telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his\njob—not to mention the strongest personal inclinations—demanded most\nstrongly that he stay alive.\n  \n \n  He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the\nseat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and\nelastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final\nscrews, he made no resistance.\n  \n \n  \"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\"\n  \n \n  \"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably.\n  \n \n  \"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n  \n \n  \"I am sitting,\" Korvin said.\n  \n \n  \"Are you a\n   \n   chulad\n   \n  ?\" the Ruler asked. A\n   \n   chulad\n   \n  was a small native\npet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch\nbeetle.\n  \n \n  \"I am not,\" he said.\n\n[Chapter: MIGHTIEST_QORN_7]\nThere was a momentary silence from all sides.\n  \n \n  \"I guess so,\" grunted a giant Qornt in iridescent blue with\nflame-colored plumes.\n  \n \n  Qorn's eyes bulged.

Zubb aimed the guns while the servant wrapped\nthree loops around Magnan's wrists, snapped a lock in place.\n  \n \n  \"You next!\" The guns pointed at Retief's chest. He held out his arms.\nFour loops of silvery-gray chain in half-inch links dropped around\nthem.

They have occupied a Terrestrial planet and issued an ultimatum, declaring their intent to take another world \"with steel and fire.\" This positions them as invaders and a direct military threat to the Terrestrials.\n\n3.  However, it is later revealed that the Qornt are not a distinct species but rather a specific caste or life stage of a larger species that also includes the Verpp. A Verpp naturalist explains that the Qornt are known for their aggressive and quarrelsome nature, viewing them as a lower, unrefined caste.\n    ##begin_quote##\n    \"The Qornt are sturdily built rascals, all over ten feet in height. And, of course, they do nothing but quarrel. A drone caste, actually.\"\n    ##end_quote##\n\n4.  The mystery of their 200-year disappearance and reappearance is explained by their life cycle.

They are of particular issue because they have reappeared and written to the Terrestrials saying they would take over the planet that the Terrestrials are on. We eventually learn that the Qornt are but one stage in a longer life cycle, in which Gwil become Boog, who become Rheuk, who become Verpp, who eventually become Qornt after the two hundred year estivation period. It is only in this stage that they become antagonistic and warlike, but they do not know what happens after this stage because Qornt are expected to die in battle, and none have survived long enough to know what happens. The Qornt themselves are twelve feet tall and troll-like, with very bushy fur, huge eyes, and beaks. They are very comfortable with their militaristic traditions—when we meet them, they are in the midst of a large feast that they partake in before going to war. They boast the spoils of battle on display in their great hall, and wear intricate headdresses to show their power. After a skirmish with the men on Roolit I, in which Qorn (the lead Qornt) is replaced in power by Retief, they eventually make it to the outer planets where they have presumably been recruited into the Peace Enforcement Corps.\n", "\tThe Qornt are a large, bird-like, warring species with scary beaks and large eyes. They are similar in looks to the Verpp but much larger and scarier. \n\tAs it turns out, the Qornt and several other species undergo a sort of metamorphosis, similar to a caterpillar becoming a butterfly in our reality. Just as the caterpillar burrows itself in a cocoon, the Verpp burrow, molt, and then re-emerge as Qornt. However, the Verpp aren’t born. They are initially of the Gwil species. The Gwil transform into the Boog, which then transform into the Rheuk, and then they become the Verpp. \n\tSadly, it’s unknown what the Qornt might become during their transformation. No Qornt has ever survived long enough to experience the next metamorphosis if there is one. They always die in battle, supposedly to make room for the Verpp to burrow again. \n", "The Qornt are an antagonistic alien race that have been rediscovered on the planet of Roolit I. They are a warlike race and have delivered an ultimatum to the Terrestrial inhabitants of Smorbrod that if they do not evacuate, they will invade. They are physically imposing, standing over 10 feet tall with a birdlike appearance.\n\nIn reality the Qornt are related to all of the other alien races on Roolit I. Each seperate race is a developmental stage of a single species. The Gwil become Boog, the Boog become Rheuk, which become Verpp which eventually become Qornt. The Qornt are predisposed to warlike tendencies so that they tend to die off and complete their life cycle in order to make room for new Qornt that develop from the Verpp. If they did not do this overpopulation would become an issue when they need to hibernate underground for 200 years. ", "The Qornt originally lived in the Concordiate times, about 200 years ago. They vanished suddenly, and no historians know where it was that they went. However, Magnan and Ratief learn from the aliens that they were simply hibernating for two centuries. They never actually left the planet. \n\nThe Qornt are led by His Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of the Qornt, Over-Lord of the Galactic Destiny. They are about eight feet tall, stand on two green legs, and move like birds. They have bushy green hair and white beaks. They love to attack other species and engage in dangerous action and war. \n\nQornt is the final stage in a long line of evolution of the being. The two beings that Magnan and Ratief meet are not actually Qornts, but Verpps. They are actually offended that the earth men mistake them for Qornts because they believe the similar but different creatures are argumentative and lowly. They are all “pud’s creatures,” but they view themselves distinctly based on their place in the evolution of the being. No one survives the Qornt stage because they are always  engaging in war. \n"]}}
